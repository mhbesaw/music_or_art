And here I thought the 9 months between the 30K &amp; 40K was super quick. Now you guys hit 50K less than 4 months later.  I love how much we've grown since joining in around 8K and how many people we've helped see the light. You guys are awesome and I truly appreciate how positive and helpful everyone is, making this the best sub on Reddit. Kindness goes a long way and it things like this giveaway I enjoy doing to give back to all of you. Stay awesome everyone!

Usually I have a Main Lights section  to make the list from and a Random Lights section which is paired randomly. I won't be doing that this time since last time we had a lot of people putting the Random Lights into the Main Lights list. So we're just going to include them all together and see how this works out this time. Little more work for you guys but I think the chances of winning are worth the effort.

###Giveaway Lights:

**[Acebeam H40 CRI](https://www.killzoneflashlights.com/products/acebeam-h40):** Like to first say thank you to Killzone Flashlights for sponsoring this light that is very new to the market. This light uses a beautiful 4000K Luminus SST-20 CRI 95+ LED and is powered by a single AA (180 lumens) or a 14500 battery (600 lumens). Features a ramping UI so you can get that perfect output for your needs. Compliments in reviews I've read include it having a great beam profile for hiking and being light weight. We have a few great reviews from members in the sub if you'd like to learn more. 

**[Acebeam X45](http://www.acebeam.com/x45):** This is being sponsored by a regular in /r/flashlight who's quite active and very helpful here. Thank you very much for your generosity. So about the light, this beast outputs 16,500 lumens from 4 XHP70 (P2) emitters and still throws 583m which is impressive considering how floody it is. It's a beast of a light. Powered by 4 high drain batteries (included), this guy easily turns night into day and will put a smile on your face every time you turn it on. 

**[Armytek Partner C2 Pro XHP35 (Warm)](https://www.armytek.com/products/flashlights/hunting-and-military/armytek-partner-c2-pro/armytek-partner-c2-pro-v3-xhp35-warm-silver.html):** I'm actually sponsoring this but I got it as part of the BOGO free promotion that Armytek was having so you can thank them for that. I've already swapped out the optics with the proper 5° TIR optic and will be including the 60° optic. All without damaging the bezel with a special tool I bought. This Partner is an impressive light outputting nearly 1600 lumens (OTF) from a single 18650. The emitter is a nice Neutral Warm color and has a great variety of output levels that are nicely spaced. Also an easy to use UI that even grandma could figure out. Can't forget the 10m impact resistances if you're the type to be rough on your tools. 

**[Armytek Elf C2 Warm](https://www.killzoneflashlights.com/products/armytek-elf-c2-xp-l-micro-usb-w-included-18650):** Another great headlamp sponsored by Killzone Flashlights. The Elf C2 has everything you want in a headlamp with a great 4000K emitter, great mode spacing, Firefly mode, a 10m impact resistance, and built-in charging. I think the best part is that it includes a clip and can easily be used as an EDC along with the magnetic tailcap which I find highly useful. 

**[Fenix CL26R](https://bestlight.io/products/fenix-cl26r):** Big shout-out to the guys from Best Light for sponsoring this new lantern and always being eager to be a part of these. Definitely owe you a beer if you're ever in my part of town for everything you've done to help out. The CL26R definitely isn't an upgrade to the popular CL25R but more of an alternative unique approach to a lantern. Slightly smaller than a soda can, the CL26R has a max output of 400 lumens powered from a single 18650 battery. Has other features like built-in charging and a battery level indicator. What's unique about this light is that it features 2 directional lights. One being that it's side lights can be switch from 360° to 180° illumination. The second being that it features a light on the bottom of it to be used when hanging the lantern. Definitely an interesting lantern with many uses.

**[Folomov EDC C1](https://www.illumn.com/pre-order-folomov-edc-c1-brass-nichia-e21a-95-cri-335-lumen-flashlight-10440-battery-w-micro-usb-charge-port-included.html) (x2):** I'd like to say thank you to the guys at Illumn for sponsoring two of these lights. I'm also going to steal their listing describing this light since there's really nothing more I can add that hasn't been said. ""*The Folomov EDC C1 is an ultra compact brass 10440 flashlight equipped with a Nichia E21A. This warm white emitter (3000K) has a 95+ CRI rating for a beautiful, color accurate beam with an output of up to 335 lumens. The included 10440 has a built-in micro USB port for convenient charging. A rear electronic switch allows for easy one-handed use.*""

**[Nitecore LC10](https://flashlight.nitecore.com/product/lc10) (x5):** I'd like to say thank you to Queenie over at Nitecore for sponsoring five of these lantern/battery charger combos. This is an easily portable Lithium-ion battery charger that can also be used as a powerbank for recharging your phone and other electronic devices. On top of that it also has a built-in [lantern](https://flashlight.nitecore.com/Uploads/attached/image/20190111/20190111145413_74109.gif) with 3 different outputs.

**[Nitecore TUP](https://www.nitecorestore.com/NITECORE-TUP-1000-Lumen-EDC-Keychain-Flashlight-p/fl-nite-tup.htm):** Korey from Nitecore Store was very kind in sponsoring the new Nitecore TUP. Definitely appreciate your generosity. The TUP is Nitecore's smallest 1000 lumens light and their smallest featuring an OLED display. Quite compact as well for being 1000 lumens and easily disappears into your pocket or can be attached on your keychain. Features built-in charging and can be used as a [constant light source](https://cdn3.volusion.com/kgjkk.sgunw/v/vspfiles/photos/FL-NITE-TUP-12.jpg) from any usb powered device. 

**[Sofirn SF14 Kit](https://www.amazon.com/Flashlight-Keychain-Waterproof-Battery-Excluded/dp/B07F8TDPW6?th=1):** Last but not least I'd like to say thank you to Sofirn for sponsoring this and the following light. They're still fairly new as a name brand but have been coming out with some great lights at great budget friendly prices. The SF14 uses a 14500 battery with an impressive 550 lumens. Small enough to fit in your pocket comfortably but powerful enough for all your needs. Can also be used with AA batteries (230 lumens) when you're on the go and don't have time to recharge. Features a fairly neutral ~5500K emitter and can be clipped on a hat when needed.

**[Sofirn SP33](https://www.amazon.com/Powerful-Flashlight-XHP50-2-Rechargeable-Battery/dp/B07KQ637VV):** This is one of their more powerful lights featuring 2500 lumens from an XHP50.2 emitter powered by a high capacity 26650 battery. Has a nice variety of modes and shortcuts to Eco &amp; Turbo modes from Off. Great for any outdoor use.

#####A big shout-out to all of the manufacturers and dealers who made this possible!! If you don't happen to win and are still looking for a light, check out the [Coupon Codes](https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/wiki/index#wiki_coupon_codes) we have in the sidebar from these awesome dealers. Most of the time their prices beat what you can find on Amazon and you get better customer service than you would from Amazon (beyond the 30 days). Also wanted to say thank you to the redditors who wanted to partake in it as well with their donations that have helped with the costs of batteries, chargers, and shipping. Really appreciate your generosity. I'd also like to say thank you to the flashlight members who helped out with setting this up and reaching out to the dealers that they are in contact with. Greatly appreciate it! (**Edit: And thank you Spaceminions for finding all of my errors.**) Stay awesome everyone and best of luck!!

Edit: Gold? That's awesome! Thank you!

Edit #2: Best Light just asked me to add 5 [Acebeam UC15](https://bestlight.io/products/acebeam-uc15) lights to the giveaway. This will be given away at random. Please do not add this to your list for as it will not be counted. This guy is a 1000 lumens keychain light when used with Lithium-Ion batteries. Pretty damn impressive for such a small size.

Edit #3: /u/ozythemandias is going to sponsor 5 random winners with a set of the [Landmark Series](https://photonphreaks.com/collections/stickers/products/landmark-series-stickers-batch-3?variant=18883073376352) from the Photon Phreaks stickers. Again, do not add these to your list as they will not be counted. ",50K Giveaway!!!,flashlight,"#Welcome to the 50K giveaway!!!

23,"Hello everyone.

Like many others here, I took the plunge into enthusiast flashlight territory.

After picking up a couple lights I've become emboldened to try a bit of modding. And ambitiously enough I'm going to attempt an incandescent Maglite Mini mod.

Mostly just for fun, and because the host is lying around.

I've done a lot of scouring on candlepowerforums, BLF, and Reddit but it seems that:

* There don't seem to be any parts lists
* Most interest in Maglite mods dwindled away in the early-mid 2000s?

I've got a bit of background in the electrical know-how as well as a Hakko 888D. This is hopefully just a sanity check and fishing for advice.

#**Considerations**

1. I don't really want to chop the body. I don't have the tools or expertise to cut it or re-assemble the threads. So probably not a ""micromag""

2. Probably going to be a 2x14500 build for the above reason though I'm willing to entertain a 1x14500 + dummy AA if that works. I am aware this will modify my driver requirements.

3. I am aware that 2S 14500 will have me matching cells and that's okay. I am choosing the highest drain protected cells I can find.

#**Tentative Build**

So without further ado, here's what I'm thinking.

It seems like the Maglite can support a 20mm MCPCB

The buck driver had me second guessing myself a bit though I think it makes sense. [Here is the link to the config I'm going with on it.](https://i.imgur.com/qa9aVTi.png) With 2x14500 in series, we're looking at 8.4V on the high end. Feeding a Nichia 219C triple would be possible with the above cells providing up to 3.5A. That should be 3V and 1.16A per LED since they're in parallel? Not sure what brightness this would produce? Is that reasonable with those emitters?

The heat sinking will need to be done as part of the pill with a copper rod. I'm just planning on buying a 3/4"" copper rod and drill out a 3/16"" hole in the center. As far as attaching the driver and MCPCB..I'm going to have to get a bit creative with retaining plastic tubing of some sort. I'm also considering thermal sealant of some sort for better heat transfer though I'm not sure about that yet. How to secure the pill in the host is still not 100% clear to me.

I hope all this stuff fits in the head of a Maglite Mini?

#**Misc**

Anyone know if they still make tailcap switches for the mini mags anywhere? I'm not finding any quality ones. Lots of poorly reviewed switches. The old Terralux TCS1s seem entirely out of manufacture.

&amp;#x200B;

**Purpose:** EDC

**Size**: Reasonably compact that is on par with the [ThruNite Neutron 2C V3](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XXFC1VN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1).  I'm a fan of a single cell 18650.

**Battery**: 18650

**Price Range**: $50-$100, but could go slightly higher if the specs are nice.

**Type:** Handheld

**Lumens:** 1000+

**Switch-Type**: Side-switch and tail-switch.  Tail stand not entirely necessary.  I've found that the ThruNite button is far too small and smooth for my thumb to find quickly.  I end up having to roll the flashlight over and over until I can find it, which doesn't work for me.

**Anything else:**  I'd like the flashlight to have a deep-pocket carrying clip that is smooth/uniform to the casing.  The reason I didn't use the ThruNite TC12 V2 is because the flashlight stuck out of my pocket about an inch, thanks to the larger tail.  The BLF has a deep carry option, but the clip is flared outward so that it catches/scrapes anything in my pocket.  I'm sure there's a perfect light out there that sits well in the pocket and can be drawn out with immediate activation.

Last year sometime I purchased a Nicron N7 with the twist top and the magnetic base... It's the one cheap-ish light out of probably over a dozen or so, that actually lasted, worked well, bright as hell and really has a col aesthetic too.

...and then I lost it somewhere. My fault.

I bought a new one this week. So happy to have one back in my pocket.

I'm a photographer that shoots events, often at night, and I really get to use a light quite a lot. I can go through a pair of batteries at one event.

So, important to have a good light.

I've always wanted to buy an expensive light, because I thought I'd need to spend more money to get quality, but if this second Nicron lasts and works as well as the first one, I'll stick with Nicron for a while.

Something I noticed yesterday... when it's set for low power, it makes a squealing sound. What's that all about?

Purpose - mostly close range just to light up dark areas in houses or yachts at work. Needs to hold up under some general use and abuse

Size - compact, for a female friend with smaller frame. She wears a work tool belt and would prefer to carry it on the belt. But does not want it to take up a lot of room. I would assume a single 18650 type size would be fine.

Battery Type &amp; Quantity - 18650 or 14500 would be good for size. She has no batteries now so would need recommendation for charger and battery included in price if does not come with it. Honestly an on board charging light with battery included might be best.

Price - Under $50

Type - I think she would prefer a straight light but if you think an angled would work good I’m open to suggestions.

Lumens - I would assume anything between 200 to 500 would be plenty

104,"I have three different Olights. Only one uses an 18650 cell. Pretty much when I bought the light I added on a samsung 30q cell and a charging port. 

I really have loved carrying my M2warrior and have never had the battery die on me. Since I just bought an Acebeam L16 and an Emisar D4, I just want to know what else I need to buy off amazon so that I can have two reliable (mainly charged) flashlights.

To simplify the question where can I get good 18650 battery cells, and possibly a decent charger for them.

108,"Wireless charging is popular on many mobile devices these days, but most of the rechargeable flashlights have either a cable you need to plug in or a magnetic charger. Brinyte has come up with a flashlight that uses inductive charging to charge up the light. Today I have a prototype version of the Brinyte WT01. Thanks to them for sending it to me to take a look at.

&amp;#x200B;

**Packaging**

With my light being a prototype the packaging was not anything near final form. It was a sturdy brown cardboard box. Accessories included the light itself, unbranded generic 3000mAh protected button top 18650 battery, Generic international 2A AC USB adapter with US adapter plug, Charging cradle and microUSB cable.

&amp;#x200B;

**Construction &amp; Design**

The light is made from aluminum, and will be offered in a sand and black anodizing. My prototype was in the Sand color and unfortunately it’s paint and not anodizing. The result is it’s not a very durable finish. I have been assured that in the production version this will be a hard anodizing.

[https://i.imgur.com/Levn5bC.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Levn5bC.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

As far as design it’s a larger light. It’s capable of using a 18650 battery with the included spacer or a 26650. Starting at the tail cap, it’s a bit large, and simple. It tail stands nicely. The tail cap is glued in place. On the body tube there is a slight ring to do a cigar grip on. Moving on to the body tube, there are rings milled in and then 4 flats milled in. On my example these flats don’t always line up with the switch which is a little disappointing.

[https://i.imgur.com/ufhmAP1.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ufhmAP1.jpg)

[https://i.imgur.com/wkOq1F7.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/wkOq1F7.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

Inside this is a double wall design, threads on the body tube are fine and square cut cut, I would prefer something a bit more course to make it a little easier to thread on and minimize the risk of cross threading. One thing that does happen is when you take off the head and put it back on the light does come on in low mode. There are springs on both the head and tail of the light.

&amp;#x200B;

The head of the light itself is pretty smooth, with minimal heat syncing. The switch is electronic and covered by a green silicone cover. It has green and red LED’s under used when charging. The front bezel is smooth, and able to be unscrewed. The glass lens is anti reflective coated. Underneath is a deep smooth reflector and the LED is nicely centered.

&amp;#x200B;

**Size and Weight**

I measured overall length at 156mm, width at its widest point was 45mm, and at it’s thinnest point 33mm. Weight with the included battery is 313g

While this light is capable of running at 26650 battery and double wall construction it just feels a bit long and a bit thick. The tailcap adds to the length. In the video version of this review I do a bit of comparison to similar type of lights.

&amp;#x200B;

**LED/Runtime**

SST-40 LED with deep smooth reflector that’s a fairly neutral white. The SST-40 is a pretty good LED in my opinion. It doesn’t seem to suffer noticeable rainbow but it does seem to turn a bit more green a lower power inputs. The beam is more of a thrower. It has a small hot center, with a small area around that center of corona before it fades into the spill.

[https://i.imgur.com/IGUffKS.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/IGUffKS.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

**Runtimes**

I did my runtime testing with the included 3000mAh generic button top protected battery the light came with. Total runtime was just at 100 minutes of usable light. It did do a pretty good job of being able to sustain it’s brightest mode for almost 20 minutes.

[https://i.imgur.com/6SmeAcc.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/6SmeAcc.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

**UI**

UI on this light is non traditional but not complicated. It has 4 output modes of constant light and starts at high, then decreases to medium, then low, each time the button is pressed then off. Press the power button again and you get turbo, then it steps down through all the lower modes. The mode spacing is pretty even to the eye.

&amp;#x200B;

Brynyte lists outputs as:

Turbo 1100 Lumens

High 430 Lumens

Medium 70 Lumens

Low 10 Lumens

Strobe and SOS 1100 Lumens

&amp;#x200B;

Long press for 2 seconds to reach the 2 blinking modes of Strobe and SOS. To go back to constant on mode you have to go through both blinking modes and the light will resume to where you left off. There were no No shortcuts to go to turbo or to shut off

&amp;#x200B;

Light does come on in low if you disconnect the head and reconnect it with a battery inside.

&amp;#x200B;

**Recharging**

This light uses wireless inductive charging in it’s cradle. The cradle is pretty basic, no instruction or lights on it, just a microUSB port. It appears to be using Qi charging, because my Anker Qi chargers recognize the light and it goes through a sequence where it starts to charge but then stops. My guess this is because the inductive coils are not oriented correctly. My guess would be these run around the tail cap and are not on the flat where they would be for a phone typically. The cradle draws 0.2A (about 1W) on standby regardless of if it’s charging or not which is kind of high.

[https://i.imgur.com/3ThJVbf.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/3ThJVbf.jpg)

[https://i.imgur.com/Ja7MahL.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Ja7MahL.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

When charging the flashlight has a Red LED inside the button that comes on and it goes green when fully charged. I observed a 1.2A charging rate during charging, so a flat battery took 3 hours and 30 minutes to fully charge. The charging curve was pretty flat, not the usual taper. At the end I measured cell voltage at 4.17V. I will insert a photo of what I found overall capacity of the cell was at when I put it through a capacity test.

One other feature I noticed when recharging this light was that when you pull it off the charger it automatically comes on in low mode, or if the power is stopped to the charger. I could see this being useful for use if your house were to lose mains power and it would help you locate the light.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pro**

* SST-40 LED, Fairly neutral white, solid beam performance
* I like that colors are being offered from the beginning. Hopefully the anodizing will be more durable.
* Nice to see someone try inductive charging on a flashlight.

&amp;#x200B;

**Con**

* It’s a chunky light, and personally I don’t find it very attractive.
* Recharging cradle draws 0.20a (About 1W) on standby regardless of if it’s charging or not. Kind of high.
* UI is just different I would like to long press to turn off, and double click to go to turbo, maybe triple click to go to strobe.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

I like the idea of wireless charging that doesn't have exposed contacts but not if the cost is a larger light. Design wise I feel like the light is just a bit too generic and large for me. I don’t love that the tail cap is glued in place, but understand why they are doing it. I would like to see them go back to the drawing board and try to reduce the overall size of the light and add some more interesting design features.

With the emergency power type of feature I think I will set this light on my kitchen counter in it’s charging cradle so that if the power goes off it will automatically come on and can easily be found. I would like to see at the minimum a UI tweak to allow you to shut off the light without cycling all the way through the other modes.

It’s fun taking a look at a prototype light, let’s see if Brinyte makes any changes to the production version before I can say definitely if I give it a recommendation or not.","[Review]Brinyte WT-01 Prototype (SST-40, Qi Wireless Charging)",flashlight,"Wireless charging is popular on many mobile devices these days, but most of the rechargeable flashlights have either a cable you need to plug in or a magnetic charger.

Only three posts have 10 correct names for lights. The big problem seems to be that Fenix lantern. Everyone wants a CL26R. Only three people actually tallied votes for the CL23R.

114,"Hi! First post in this sub!  

So, I work in a power plant, and I'm required to have a headlamp on my hardhat. Thing is, hardhats are uncomfortable at best, and when you've got 100+ grams of weight on the front brim, it tends to sag down over time. So I've got a cheap coast headlamp on, because it's got a rear mounted battery pack. But it's not a good light. And most of the ones I see online have three to a million (okay, I think the max I saw was 12...) LEDs and claim absurd lumens!

I've poked around and haven't been able to find a headlamp that meets the r/flashlight kind of standards. All the good headlamps are single 18650 with all the weight in a single unit up front. I've been considering the O-light H1R and the various Armytek 18350 lights, but Id rather have the battery life of an 18650 or two.

So, if anyone happens to know of a good off the shelf 18650 rear-pack light, please let me know! 

What I'm also willing to do, is take one of those cheap POS lights and drop in a quality driver/emitter. Or even use head from a light and build the sucker from the ground up if I'm desperate!

Operational desires:

\- A low of 10-40 lumens for paperwork that won't blind me

\- High of 1000+ lumens for when I need to SEE

\- 2 or three in between levels for various situations and hands on work. 

\- Not overly floody, as I don't want it to be too easy to blind co-workers, but no need for lots of throw, as I have a pocket light for that. A flip-up frosted lens might be appropriate.

\- adjustable vertical angle

\- Tint isn't overly important, but high CRI could help see color of oil or equipment discoloration

\- Easy to find/use button, as work gloves are likely to be worn. 

\- Durable - hardhats run into things. Can't have a lamp get smashed, or a battery cover popping off and an 18650 go somewhere I can't get it out!

&amp;#x200B;

I've just ordered an SOIC clip and programmer, so if it's got a flashable chip, that'd be a bonus!

Thanks in advance! And if I've managed to miss a similar thread in my searches, please forgive me and point me in the right direction! ",[Help Me] Looking for a quality rearpack headlamp...or the pieces to build one!,flashlight,"Hi! First post in this sub!

117,"TL;DR: Pretty sure what I want is an ArmyTek Elf, Wizard, or Wizard Pro. But if there are any better suggestions in the community, or any thoughts on distinguishing between the three from ArmyTek, I'd love any/all input and suggestions! My original plan was to pick up a right-angle Zebralight, but none of them appear to have integrated charging. I think I've more or less got my [options narrowed down](http://flashlights.parametrek.com/index.html?type=angle+flex+headlamp&amp;battery=1x18650&amp;lumens=_+_+inc&amp;features=integrated%20charger+sub-lumen&amp;led_color=neutral%20white+warm%20white+white&amp;environment=weather%20resistant+weatherproof+water%20resistant+waterproof+IPX7+IP67+IPX8+IP68+1m&amp;beam_angle=1.0+293) thanks to Parametrek. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Price Range**:  Consider it infinite for the right light. If you don't want to consider it infinite, consider it... $150 USD for the bare, empty light. I have chargers and can source batteries locally. I am located in Canada.

**Purpose**:  The specific impetus for this purchase is a \~2 week canoe trip I'm planning, but it might also end up living in my backpack or on my belt as an EDC, and probably become my default choice for a grab and go every-use-light. I am going to be guiding on the canoe trip and anticipate I may need to use the light extensively, and rather than carry extra batteries, I would like to take advantage of the USB solar panel and power banks I'll have anyway to just top off the light.

**Battery Type &amp; Quantity**: One 18650. Light also must have integrated charging so I can plug it into a solar panel/battery pack.

**Size**:  Flexible, I imagine the ""single 18650"" lights are all fairly similarly sized. If I'm worried about size/weight, I'd bring my [Fenix HL50](http://www.fenixlight.com/ProductMore.aspx?id=130) instead. It's teeny, and weighs very little with a CR123.

**Type**:  Right angle light/headlamp.

**Main Use**:  Mainly general camp use - cooking, settling into a tent, setting up or breaking down camp, making it to the outhouse at night. Some walking on trail/off trail at night will almost definitely happen. An average or relatively floodier light with a diffuse hot spot would probably be the winner. Secondary use is just all those times you need to grab a light from your pocket. I EDC an Emisar D4 presently.

**Switch Type**:  No preference. I can get used to wherever a switch is, and I'll learn the UI.

&amp;#x200B;

**Anything Else?**:

* Neutral or warm white distinctly preferred. (It would be my first warm white light, if I went that way, since the incandescents of days past).
* Moonlight/firefly/sub-lumen modes are distinctly preferred.
* The light must be waterproof, IPx7 or IPx8 should do.
* High CRI would be nice but is not mandatory.
* I'm aiming for a max output of roughly 800-1000 lumens or greater. 
* I'm not sure what to think about the Micro USB charging versus magnetic charge cables. It seems Micro USB would be a better option as I have a pile of USB cables, whereas a magnetic cable I'd need to buy a spare. Either should be fine, though. Can anyone share their experience with usability?
* Sourcing from Canada would be preferred, as I've had bad luck with cross border stuff. Prime-eligible on [amazon.ca](https://www.amazon.ca) is the theoretical best condition, but shipping from anywhere should work as long as it's a reputable seller.
* I'm not sure if it's a thing for high end headlamps (or at least I haven't seen it on any) but back in the day, I really liked the feature of my [Petzl Myo](https://www.petzl.com/US/en/Sport/ACTIVE-headlamps/MYO) where it had a flip down diffuser. Then again, modern lights can just compensate with more sheer brightness if needed and I've never needed the flood/throw combo with even the \~300 lumens my Fenix HL50 provides.

Got the light in, and he had already taken it apart, including a torn up switch boot.   I tested the driver and could only get a half  volt to the emitters.   The emitters all tested ok.

Hank from International Outdoors sent me a new driver and a couple of switch boots for 10 dollars delivered.   Told him what had happened, and he immediately said ""the problem is the driver"", not the electronic switch.  I figured he must have seen this many times to be that sure about it.  

6wks later, the driver and boots arrive.  Wires already soldered on the new driver.  The bezel had a fairly major ding in it, so I sanded it down, re-shaped it a bit, and polished it out.  Hank was right.  Soldered all six wires back and she works like a charm.

I have a similar experience if I press the tail-cap button. The light is bright for about half a second, then dims. After another second or so with the tail-cap button depressed, the light flashes rapidly. Normally, the light would go to turbo mode and start flashing.

154,"I was considering getting [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Warsun-KS-08-Rechargeable-1200Lumens-Backpacking/dp/B07DCL81W3) and would be interested in what /r/flashlight thinks about it. It does use 2x 18650s, and a person in the reviews said they were able to add a third one pretty easily. The prospect of replacing those cells and having 3x high capacity 18650s in that form factor sounds pretty nice.

I do have my doubts that it actually outputs 1200 lumens, and unfortunately it looks like it has a pretty crappy UI (looks like you have to scroll through SOS to turn it off). 

I tried to find something like this from a more commonly recommended manufacturer, but based on how many people here bought that harbour freight work light I'm not sure something like that exists. The closest thing I could find was the [LR12](https://www.nitecorestore.com/NITECORE-LR12-2-in-1-Design-Lantern-Flashlight-p/fl-nite-lr12.htm), but that's not really the same. I also find it hard to spend $50 on a 1000 lumen light when lots of others do the same or more for half that.

**Main Use**:  Likely keep it in a pack or jacket pocket when I need it soon.  Walking around in steep, rocky, mountainous terrain 6000 to 13000 plus feet.

**Switch Type**:  I don't mind. I just need an on and off button.

Purpose:I will be carrying it at work only and my attire is business casual, jeans allowed.

Size: Small enough to disappear in the bottom of my pants pockets like my Fisher space pen bullet does. I would like to avoid any visible bulge to the pockets if possible.

Type: Handheld, keychain but I'll use it separately so nothing too stubby. 

Main Use: work carry for inspection up to 10 feet away in fairly well lit areas. Sometimes used to ""point"" out things.  

Switch Type: Anything easily done with one hand, but I'm open to twist lights.

Anything Else?: I already have a coast G10 and the beam has no spill. Far to tidy for up close. I also have used a Streamlight stylus pro, but I don't want to have a bunch of stuff clipped on the edge of my pocket. I know I'm asking a lot of a light that may not exist.

&amp;#x200B;

I also have just ordered a V6 Catapult, so throw is covered.... for now haha.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't like the cool white tint Olight gives, and the light actually makes my eyes hurt after using it for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

I would prefer all the lights be be high CRI, as colour rendering does matter, and I find poor light hurts my eyes after using it for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

**Lights Needed**

A strong, floody and throwy light, for walking in the woods, fields and up dark country lanes with the dog, good battery life - to replace the R50 - I want a similar beam pattern, and battery life.

&amp;#x200B;

Headlamp - For close up work, gutting rabbits, working on the car, outside work - H2R replacement

&amp;#x200B;

EDC - To replace the S30R III - Something around the same size, not bigger though.

**The lights I had in Mind, in order:**

&amp;#x200B;

D4S SST20 4k - What's the battery life like running around 500-600 lumens? How much throw? or  
SC700d by Zebralight? Again, what's the beam and battery life like compared the the R50 Pro?

&amp;#x200B;

SC600w Mk IV Plus - EDC - 4500k - Again, how much throw and spill? Comparable to the S30R?

&amp;#x200B;

Are there any other lights I should be looking at?

After having a few of the $7 eBay lights and constantly being mocked at work by the resident flashlight nerd - I mean COLLECTOR (AKA ""Captain Kirk""), - i.e. ""get that hand grenade away from me"", ""you're going to set yourself on fire"", etc. I bought the SP36 on his recommendation. Build quality is exceptional. The ability to charge via USB without removing the batteries is the ultimate in convenience. I can illuminate a ball field with this thing. It also seems to run forever. I bought the kit because I couldn't remember all the instructions for finding the best battery from Captain Kirk, so I figured the ones from the same manufacturer were probably a good choice. I told him I had some 80 cent UltraFire batteries leftover and that about sent him into a stroke. So I guess those are bad. It comes with the version 1.2 user interface which I am told is the bomb, however I keep it in idiot mode for now. I expect to receive proper operator training when I go back to work, and will take notes.

All in all this is an expensive (compared to e-Bay) light but is built like a tank and has tons of cool features I've yet to learn. This is the best built flashlight since my 1990 era 3 ""D"" cell MagLite. One thing I did note is that if you heat up the floor in front of you, your cat will lay there! At least mine does.

205,"The Thrunite Ti5 is a bit of a cult classic in /r/flashlight. A little over 100 lumens in a tiny AA light with a tail clicky and three modes, including *real* moonlight. Even the strobe mode is reasonably well hidden, requiring two full mode rotations to access. This light has been discontinued for some time and is essentially impossible to buy, except in Canada where Amazon has over 100 in stock, including the Ti5T (titanium). I purchased one on a whim after seeing regulars like /u/zak and /u/parametrek talk about their Ti5s fondly, and obviously set about modding it right away. I've since purchased one more for myself, and one that's heading to a new owner shortly.

This is a relatively simple mod, though a bit fiddly because everything is just so tiny. The driver unscrews easily with pointed tweezers (no glue), then it's just a matter of removing the reflector gasket, desoldering the leads, reflowing a new LED, and putting it all back together.

So far I've tried Nichia 219B in sw40, sw45, and sw45k, as well as Nichia E21A on a tiny Virence MCPCB. The latter was not particularly successful because the LED is so short the reflector gasket needs to be filed paper thin to focus correctly. The sw40 219B had issues with a yellow blob in the centre of the beam which I got tired pursuing and swapped out for the Samsung. I did reduce the height of the Nichia reflector gaskets because the 219B has a lower optical reference than the Crees it replaced, but it's not strictly necessary. It's also important to snap the edges of the cutout down if the LED doesn't sit in it snugly, as is the case for the 219B.

#Output

Thrunite is a little optimistic about the output, but reasonably close. The 219B versions have somewhat lower output, but the dedomed LH351D actually bumps it up a little.

#Colour

Colour data is measured with an X-Rite i1Studio. Two of these lights were originally XP-G2, but I don't have colour measurements for them. The latest one was an XP-L model, and the stock LED was truly horrendous. Dirty green tint and ultra low CRI. I think it's safe to see that all three replacement LEDs are a dramatic improvement. Which one you prefer will be personal preference.

#Final Thoughts

This is a really neat light to begin with, and changing the emitter is a dramatic improvement, especially for the horrendous XP-L one I received. I knew the Nichia LEDs would be great, but the most interesting thing is how nicely the dedomed 5000K LH351D is. I've already put one of these in a Zebralight SC64c with [very nice results](http://budgetlightforum.com/comment/1478992#comment-1478992), and it performs just as well in the Ti5. It's particularly nice for a low power option with that lovely tint and quite reasonable CRI. The only thing it's missing is a higher R9.","[NED] Thrunite Ti5 in 3 flavours of high CRI, with colour measurements",flashlight,"The Thrunite Ti5 is a bit of a cult classic in /r/flashlight.

This is a relatively simple mod, though a bit fiddly because everything is just so tiny. The driver unscrews easily with pointed tweezers (no glue), then it's just a matter of removing the reflector gasket, desoldering the leads, reflowing a new LED, and putting it all back together.

So far I've tried Nichia 219B in sw40, sw45, and sw45k, as well as Nichia E21A on a tiny Virence MCPCB. The latter was not particularly successful because the LED is so short the reflector gasket needs to be filed paper thin to focus correctly. The sw40 219B had issues with a yellow blob in the centre of the beam which I got tired pursuing and swapped out for the Samsung. I did reduce the height of the Nichia reflector gaskets because the 219B has a lower optical reference than the Crees it replaced, but it's not strictly necessary. It's also important to snap the edges of the cutout down if the LED doesn't sit in it snugly, as is the case for the 219B.

#Output

Thrunite is a little optimistic about the output, but reasonably close. The 219B versions have somewhat lower output, but the dedomed LH351D actually bumps it up a little.

#Colour

Colour data is measured with an X-Rite i1Studio. Two of these lights were originally XP-G2, but I don't have colour measurements for them. The latest one was an XP-L model, and the stock LED was truly horrendous. Dirty green tint and ultra low CRI. I think it's safe to see that all three replacement LEDs are a dramatic improvement. Which one you prefer will be personal preference.

#Final Thoughts

This is a really neat light to begin with, and changing the emitter is a dramatic improvement, especially for the horrendous XP-L one I received. I knew the Nichia LEDs would be great, but the most interesting thing is how nicely the dedomed 5000K LH351D is. I've already put one of these in a Zebralight SC64c with [very nice results](http://budgetlightforum.com/comment/1478992#comment-1478992), and it performs just as well in the Ti5. It's particularly nice for a low power option with that lovely tint and quite reasonable CRI. The only thing it's missing is a higher R9.[NED] Thrunite Ti5 in 3 flavours of high CRI, with colour measurements"

I was referred to here by a friend when telling him I’m looking for a quality flashlight to use in the field. I’m in the army and so I’m looking for something can can be hooked to my uniform. To remain in regulation, it would have to be black or coyote brown (out of personal preference I would love it to be the brown).

I’d like something bright(?). And I suppose dimmable would be great too.

If anyone can make any suggestions that they believe to be good flashlights, I’d love to hear it!

I’ve done tons of searching, but I am really at a loss of what a good flashlight is.  This is what I’ve found so far, it leans very much on the expensive side, but I don’t know how bright it is, or if this flashlight is worth the price.

I had a bit of an accident with my Wizard and... just kidding. Intentionally smashing flashlight lenses will never get old! Clemence of [Virence.com](http://www.virence.com/) has been telling me about how great the sm653 (6500K) E21A is as a work light for ages, so I finally purchased a pre-flowed MCPCB in 12V configuration a few months ago. Armytek has a pretty good price on the Wizard Pro on amazon.ca right now and I decided it would be a good opportunity to use the sm653 MCPCB.

Getting started, popping off the bezel with minimal visible damage requires smashing the glass lens then inserting a tool under the lip and slide hammering it out.

https://i.imgur.com/SVFmLRV.jpg

Then you get to the tricky part of removing the battery tube so you can pop out the driver and solder new leads to replace the short tiny gauge ones Armytek uses. Clemence tells me heat usually breaks the thread locker, but I had a hellish experience with my last Wizard battery tube removal, which turned out to have red Loctite in the threads. I wasn't sure what to expect, so I broke out the contraption I made last time, which got the tube off in short order. It's important to stuff something inside the tube to prevent deformation from the clamping force.

https://i.imgur.com/nONv7gy.jpg

With that sorted, we can move on to the next step after desoldering the switch leads and snipping off the original MCPCB.

https://i.imgur.com/utFF0sI.jpg

The driver is installed from below, with the cavity filled with silicone potting compound. It sits in a shelf and is held in by the battery tube screwing down on the perimeter, which explains why Armytek puts thread locker there.

https://i.imgur.com/Mcb3DE0.jpg

A frequent Armytek issue: poorly soldered leads. One of the switch wires had literally a single strand connected to the pad.

https://i.imgur.com/LguwhGU.jpg

After replacing the leads and fixing Armytek's sloppy soldering, it's just a matter of screwing in the new Virence MCPCB, reconnecting everything, and adding a custom modified optic, also from Virence. The original optic will crush the LEDs if you try to use it, so it's absolutely worth spending the $2 on a custom milled Yajiamei optic from Clemence that sits just above the phosphor.

#Runtime

I didn't do any runtime testing for this mod. I've posted runtime charts for the stock Wizard in the past, but it's probably best to simply refer to /u/zak's Wizard Pro review.

http://budgetlightforum.com/node/55691


#Output

Armytek's output specs for the Wizard are rather optimistic. My measurements in a calibrated integrating tube are about 25% lower. I've put in preliminary measured output values for the E21A mod, but they will be somewhat lower once I'm able to press the bezel, so I'll edit them in for future reference.

Level | Lumens (claimed) | XHP50 (measured) | E21A (measured)
---|---|---|---
Turbo 2 | 1800 | 1319 | 1250
Turbo 1 | 900 | 662 | 624
Main 3 | 390 | 286 | 264
Firefly 3 | 5.5 | 1.4 | 1.4



#Colour

Colour data is measured with an X-Rite i1Studio. This was a ""warm"" Wizard, and the stock XHP50 is 3500K and CRI 70 with a very green tint. The E21A is... somewhat better. Duv takes a big swing on the turbo levels with CCT rising as well, but Main 3 where I would use it most of the time is perfect.

High CRI including R9, excellent tint other than the firefly modes (and even then the positive Duv is not very noticeable), and output nearly as good as stock.

293,"Hey guys, this will be my first high powered light and I'm struggling with which emitter to pick. On my Olight S1R ii, I noticed that at lower power, there was a definite green tint - this went away as the power levels went up. I'd like to avoid this on the D4S, but it seems this is inherent to most emitters, or maybe just the ones I'm looking at? 

I was originally set on the SST20 5k option - it seemed to have nearly all of the benefits of the XPL HI 5k, but its $15 cheaper, and throws further (which I like). I actually don't mind cooler tints (the 6500k on my S1R didn't bother me), but since this is an enthusiast light, I'm now leaning towards the SST20 4k - it has a much higher CRI of 95 vs 65 or 70 in the 5k, and it outputs 3000 lm vs 4000lm in the 5k SST20. Am I correct in thinking I would barely notice a brightness difference between 3000 and 4000 lumens? Or is the jump in output noticeable? 

As far as heat, at full turbo, how do the 4k and 5k SST20 options compare? Is the 5k going to actually heat up less despite higher output because it's more efficient? How much difference are we talking here? Is the XPL HI significantly cooler than either? Everyone talks about how the 219C's are absurdly hot - if the 4k SST20 is similar, I think that's a deal breaker.


In a nutshell, I was set on the SST20 5k for price / performance / output, but if I wouldn't notice the difference in max output, and it doesn't get any hotter, I feel I'd probably be better served going with the much better CRI of the SST20 4k, so long as the tint is good, and the (visible) max output and heat management is comparable to the SST20 5k","Need help with D4S emitter choice - SST20 4k vs 5k? vs XPL HI?

348,"**Purpose -** Primarily for urban Search and Rescue, secondarily as a hands-free hiking light.

**Size -** Since it's gonna be a headlamp, something that is relatively lightweight and compact but can fit 1x 18650.

**Battery Type &amp; Quantity -** 1x 18650 or 2x CR123s, would appreciate suggestions on what to buy for max runtime and reliability. For the 18650, something that also shares batteries with my Olight M2R would be fantastic.

**Price Range -** up to $90 all in but am a little flexible. Already have a charger.

**Type -** Headlamp **that can also attach to a hardhat or be used with a hardhat.** Bonus points if it can  also attach to a hat via a clip, and a bump helmet. Extra bonus point for something that I can attach to a vest or chest rig.

**Lumens -** Not too sure, would prefer something that has a range of brightness levels but needs to have a primary mode that allows at least 8 - 12h of runtime at a good level (250 lumens?) Should be bright enough to allow quick identification of things in a large room or long hallway. Would prefer something more floody as my handheld is more throwy.

**Switch Type -** Preferably a click/button that is easy to use with thick gloves. Am okay with a second ""modes"" button.  Would like to have the option to ""lock out"" the light to prevent accidental activation when stored.

**Anything Else? -** Yes:

* 90° or otherwise able to table stand would be great.

* I need it for a training course in a week, so preferably something I can buy off Amazon or a brick &amp; mortar store, or for sure shipped and received by next Friday 3/29 without going over budget. 

* Waterproof and durable enough to withstand rainstorms and drops in puddles; that said, will likely sit in a pack 90% of the time. 

* I like cool white lights but perhaps a neutral or warmer tone may be better for SAR.

After suggesting one that meets the above criteria, I would also appreciate suggestions for a headlamp that is worth waiting for and I don't need to have in hand within a week.

&amp;#x200B;

**Purpose** \- General Purpose.  Primary use is random indoor use, power outages, looking under furniture for things, etc.  Secondary will be carrying outside in the dark (wider beam) to check for noises, check/work on equipment at night, etc.  Very infrequent use.  Will be stored in a drawer in the house.

**Size** \- I really like the size of the SK68 ""Ultrafire"" style that I can hold with my fingers wrapped around it and my thumb on the tail button.  I don't want one terribly longer than this, nor something too large to hold in that fashion.

**Battery Type &amp; Quantity** \- Single AA due to size.  suppose I would be open to a AAA or multi AAA if the size stays reasonable for my desired size/hold style.  Nothing rechargable or fancier than that needed.

**Price Range** \- I am open here.  More than the $3-4 each the cheapies are for sure.  I am guessing there are good options in the 20-30 range, possibly even up into the 40s if necessary.  The less the better as I may want to buy more to put in other areas of the house, but I want something more reliable than what I had previously.

**Type** \- Handheld, tail button.  Being able to stand on the tail would be nice but not required.

**Lumens** \- Any.  If it shines light it will probably be fine.  I don't need it to burn through the standard AA/AAA batteries too fast.  I am coming from an Amazon HWA/WTS UltraFire cheapie which was plenty bright if that helps.

**Switch Type** \- Needs a tail switch.  I am okay if it has a secondary switch.

**Anything Else**? - I did like the adjustable focus on the SK68/UltraFire I had (it died a quick death) which let me focus it for narrow indoor tasks or widen up for lighting a path to walk outside at night.  Not required though as I am seeing most of the lights in the recommendations/Parametrek search don't have that.

First off, thank you for any assistance the community can give. I've read through all About materials and been a long time lurker, but honestly I'm a bit overwhelmed on my first real light upgrade selection.

My current two go-to lights are a 2 D cell Maglight LED (168 lumens) and a 2 CR123 cell 5.11 TMT L2 (320 lumens). I'd like more light than the Maglight, and am getting tired of throwing away non-rechargeable batteries. 

Main uses of lights are urban neighborhood dog walks and illuminating my poorly lit backyard at night (when trying to get dogs back in at night). Streets on night walks aren't completely dark, but I also dont want to annoy neighbors with huge flood. Not interested in head lamp setup. I'd like to keep cost below $180 if possible. 

Thanks again for any help!

My current two go-to lights are a 2 D cell Maglight LED (168 lumens) and a 2 CR123 cell 5.11 TMT L2 (320 lumens). I'd like more light than the Maglight, and am getting tired of throwing away non-rechargeable batteries. 

Main uses of lights are urban neighborhood dog walks and illuminating my poorly lit backyard at night (when trying to get dogs back in at night). Streets on night walks aren't completely dark, but I also dont want to annoy neighbors with huge flood. Not interested in head lamp setup. I'd like to keep cost below $180 if possible. 

Thanks again for any help!

365,"This recommendation form is pretty awesome. Props to whoever designed it. I've looked through the recommendation thread on the sidebar and found some good stuff. I didn't dig through the comments though. Either way, I'd like to see more of what's out there.

**Price Range**:  Less than $50 on the AA/AAA and less than $100 on the 18650

**Purpose**:  Daily carry. The AA/AAA being for when I'm in gym/lightweight shorts.

**Battery Type &amp; Quantity**:  Single battery in both categories ideally. Must be an 18650 though, as that's what I use for my vape. The batteries pull double duty.

**Size**:  Preferably as small as possible for both. I carry an Astrolux S41 right now and would like a smaller/lighter 18650 multiple emitter light that isn't the Convoy

**Type**:  Handheld. I'm not opposed to a 90°, but not exactly looking for one.

**Main Use**:  Providing substantial illumination to things that suffer from a lack of illumination. Being inadvertently dropped on the ground. Occasional forays through the washing machine. Soaking panties. Inducing seizures. Disturbing the peace. Lighting cigarettes as a fun party trick. Communicating across Lake Ponchartrain through Morse code.

**Switch Type**:  Not a twisty. Side switch seems like it'd be an interesting change, but I'm not set one way or another on the button. If there's an optional pressure switch for mounting to a rifle on the 18650, that'd be awesome.

**Anything Else?**:  I currently own an Astrolux S41 and a Convoy S2(specific variant unknown). The Convoy flies my bedside table for use in a pinch. I've owned a L3 Illumination L11c and I'm hoping it turns up someday. I really need a replacement for it. I wouldn't be opposed to getting another if that's the best option out there because I was really impressed with it for the size and price. I had an ArmyTek 18650, model unremembered, but wasn't a fan.

I know a bit about the aspects of electricity/lighting, having left my job at a home lighting distributor yesterday, so you can use big words. Electricity is still scary to me, and as much as I'd like to start modding lights I feel like I'd blow my hand off. I would like to get into modding at some point, which will start with the Convoy S2 when I need a break from my other projects. But if my next light is mod friendly, it'll be on the list as well.

**Other random, not as important requirements for the 18650:**

Deeper carry. I don't want half the light sticking out

Firefly mode

Bright as fuck(or maybe just shit. Gotta make that CRI compromise)

Ability to add a filter to make the light blue so I can see in my reef tank at night

**For AA/AAA**

Tight fitting pocket clip. My S41 falls out of my thinner shorts all the time

I'm much more willing to have a longer body than a wide body

Water resistant

I could be convinced to carry a 2x AAA light

411,"So long story short, I had a flashlight I carried every day for around 5 years. It was stolen off of my table by a now fired home healthcare aid. It was a coast g20. I'm looking to replace it with something that is maybe a bit better of a flashlight overall, but I want that same type of beam. They call it an ""inspection beam"" but I don't know that other flashlight companies will use the same term. Basically, the beam and light distribution is clear, even, and has a nice focused edge to it.

Can anyone familiar with that flashlight recommend something with a similar beam type? It doesn't have to be a penlight, but I don't want something massive. I'm most interested in something with that nice clean beam, making small details clear when held or within arms reach is more important than beam distance to me.

Thanks in advance for suggestions!","Need advice on purchasing new flashlight, trusty old one was stolen.",flashlight,"So long story short, I had a flashlight I carried every day for around 5 years. It was stolen off of my table by a now fired home healthcare aid. It was a coast g20. I'm looking to replace it with something that is maybe a bit better of a flashlight overall, but I want that same type of beam. They call it an ""inspection beam"" but I don't know that other flashlight companies will use the same term. Basically, the beam and light distribution is clear, even, and has a nice focused edge to it.

I'm sure there is some sort of sensible solution to this problem, but instead I chose to buy another light.

Enter the YLP Panda 3.0.  This time two weeks ago I had only heard a whisper of the YLP name around reddit, then u/bmengineer linked the [Panda](http://ylplight.com/en/katalog/1/nalobnye-fonari/panda-30/) in a recommendation thread and for what ever reason the light struck a chord with me.  Note: all images shot in daylight white balance except for the first two which are cell phone pics.

**Features:**

XP-L HI 4200k (yay!) + XP-G3 4200(?)k (meh...)

Dual TIR, one tight spot and one textured flood, combinable operation

Type III hard anodization

18650, protected or unprotected, 65-70mm length accepted, no support for 2xCR123 or 2x16340

Decently strong magnetic battery cap (removable magnet)

IPX8 Claimed, 1M drop rated

Thermal sensor (supposedly) cuts output if light gets too hot

LVP, light will shut off to prevent over-discharge, can be defeated to use in hidden low mode

Low batt indicator as well as charge level blinking

&amp;nbsp;

[All pics](https://imgur.com/a/BrTbPsI)

&amp;nbsp;

**Unboxing:**

The light arrived to the Western U.S. from Russia in 11 total days from date of order.  Not bad at all, and I've seen others that said it took as little as 6 days.  [The box](https://imgur.com/B53oj6D) is handsome and sturdy, with a magnetically clasping lid that took me a second to figure out.  [Inside](https://imgur.com/LeIf9WM) we have the light with attached and assembled head band, a set of extra o-rings, and instructions.

&amp;nbsp;

**Construction:**

Having only just gotten the light, I can't speak to durability yet, however my first impressions are that this is a pretty well made piece of equipment.  Nothing about it feels cheap so far.  In fact I really like [the design in general](https://imgur.com/rC9ChHH), an understated utilitarian industrial look to it.  Perhaps a flavoring of its homeland.  Threads are triangle cut and hearty, and they came well-lubed.  The body is ever so slightly asymmetrical, as the battery cap extends that end of the light a few extra mm out in one direction.  The light body has cooling fins cut around the battery tube, and while they aren't sharp, they aren't super smooth either. The two operating buttons are on top of the body.  

The front plate of the light is removable using a T6 Torx screwdriver, there is an o-ring surrounding that plate and the fit is tight enough for me to believe the IP-X8 rating, if only just.  I wouldn't take it swimming is what I'm getting at, but I'd have no worries using it in the rain.  Inside the plate are two small glass lenses, o-rings, then the TIR optics, which just fall out if you pull on them.  On my copy, the XP-L HI is just *slightly* off center of the optic, which is unfortunate because they can't be moved or changed due to the fact that:

The emitters and driver circuit are [all part of the same board](https://imgur.com/mGpu12i).  Makes sense for manufacturing and design, makes modders like me sad.  I would have reflowed something else where that XP-G3 is before I even sat down and started writing this review if I could have.  Ah well, can't have it all, right?  The driver does use PWM as I was [able to capture it](https://imgur.com/YCa4Su4) with my camera, but I can't notice it in any mode with just my eyes.  In fact I couldn't get a clear picture of it at any shutter speed.

The tail magnet is strong enough to hold the light in any orientation, [in this picture](https://imgur.com/8uVNus0) the power supply is actually aluminum, the light is being held by the transformer behind the aluminum.  This was about the limit of the magnet, as I had to carefully make sure it stayed there before getting that shot.

The headband came assembled (thank god because I can never figure those out) and seems to be pretty decent quality.  It fits comfortably, is easy to adjust, and has a neat [wavy rubbery layer](https://imgur.com/2XZOXZf) on the inside that I haven't seen before.  It seems to help the band from sliding around, and despite what I was expecting, it did not pinch or pull hair at all; it was quite nice feeling, very secure.

&amp;nbsp;

**Modes, Runtime, Operation:**

The Panda 3.0 has the ability to run both emitters at the same time, or switch between them quickly, a feature that was key in my decision to buy one.  I think multi-emitter setups should be the standard for head lamps, with at the very least a flood light plus a distance light.  

According to the specs from YLP, both emitters are outputting the same luminous flux at each level, and therefore having both on simply doubles outputs (and halves runtime).  My measured current draws tell me their estimates are conservative and/or based off older batteries, as well as that I'm not sure if I trust the thermal throttling:

Hidden Low - 10/20lm (150/75 hours)  (measured 27.1mA draw with both emitters running in Hidden Low, with 3500mAh cell that works out to about 129 hours vs 75 claimed)

Low - 35/70lm (36/18 hours)  (measured ~120mA draw with both emitters running in Low, 3500mAh batt = 29.1 hours vs 18 claimed)

Medium - 120/240lm (10/5 hours)  (measured ~325mA draw with both emitters running in Medium, 3500mAh batt = 10.7 hours vs 5 claimed)

High 240/480lm (5/2.5 hours)  (measured ~700mA draw with both emitters running in High, 3500mAh batt = 5 hours vs 2.5 claimed)

Turbo 550/1100lm  (varies by thermal control?)  (Initially started drawing about 4.0 amps out of my power supply, current draw then steadily increased to about 4.60A over the course of 90-120 seconds, at which point the light was too hot to touch for more than about 1 second and it had still not throttled back, so I shut it off)

The UI is pretty intuitive, and many features of it are already well-known to most of us, for example, one click on/one click off, double clicking takes both emitters to turbo, a single click will then return to what ever mode you had before going to turbo.  The only thing you have to get a grasp of is that there are two buttons, and remember which one is which.  While wearing the light on your head, the button on the right is the grey button, left side is the black button.  I'll attempt to explain the UI:

&amp;nbsp;

From Off:

Grey button single click = on in remembered emitter (either or both) and brightness (remembers turbo, not hidden low)

Grey button hold = on in remembered emitter at hidden low mode (either or both)

Grey button triple click = blink battery level, 1-5 blinks indicate charge state

Black button double click = both emitters turbo

Black button hold = throw emitter only turbo


While On:

Grey button single click = off

Grey button hold = cycle brightness L-M-H-T-L-M-H-T...

Black button single press = cycle emitters Flood-Throw-Both-Flood-Throw-Both...

Black button hold = max throw brightness, does not change flood status, if you continue to hold it will turn off flood.

Black button double click = same as from off, both emitters go to turbo.

While on either Turbo mode:

Black button single click = return to previous mode

&amp;nbsp;

While both emitters are running, holding Grey to change modes will sync the brightness of both emitters to the same level, however if you set each brightness individually and then switch to both running, they will maintain their respective set levels, another feature I like for reasons I can't define.

The two switches have backlights, during [normal operation they are green](https://imgur.com/Rr5std4), however they turn red when the battery gets low.  Mine turn red at exactly 3.29V, and interestingly they don't turn green again until you get back to 3.5V.  Brightness in all modes falls with battery voltage, noticeable below about 3.7V, but modes retain relative spacing all the way down to 2.7V.  Turbo measured ~130mA draw at 2.7V, Hidden low was less than 5mA as it didn't register on my .01A power supply display.

LVP kicked in for me at an impressively low *2.70V*, making in my eyes YLP's claim of this light being a professional product a little more true.  Professional products push limits.  You know, for all those times I'll be trapped in a cave when I'd gladly sacrifice a lithium battery for another hour or two of light.  The manufacturer claims LVP can be defeated by loosening the cap for a few seconds, then turning the light on in Hidden Low, however I found that any voltage over 2.70, the light would still ignite, and any voltage under 2.69, the light would not ignite.

&amp;nbsp;

**Light:**

I really like the light coming out of the XP-L HI.  It's a nice medium-warm spot, on the order of 5-6 degrees probably, and about what I've come to expect from this emitter.  I've gotta say, the XP-L HI is one of my favorite emitters, and this one is no disappointment.  Throw is good, the claimed 550 lumen rating seems believable.  With both emitters running at turbo, claimed output is 1100 lumens.  It seems plausible comparing output to some of my other known output lights in that range, but it is difficult to tell because of the two emitters putting out different beams.

The XP-G3, however... is just okay.  The tint is... warm?  I guess?  Kinda?  My camera in daylight WB [says it's warm...](https://imgur.com/lT47lfE) It's damn near purple in comparison to the XP-L though.  I'm glad it isn't green... The optic does a nice job of smoothing out one of the worst beams in the industry right now, but it can only go so far.  I'd really like to replace it with something like a 3000k XM-L2...  Enough about the crap tint, as far as being a flood light, it does in fact succeed, though I might throw a layer of DC-fix on there for good measure.  If you're only using the flood light, you get used to the tint pretty quick, and to be fair my “purple” comparison was in relation to daylight, where the XP-L HI was just nice and straw-colored.  Leave it to a camera to make the more pleasing tint of [the XP-L HI look uglier than the XP-G3](https://imgur.com/3daPvXb), but I promise it's much nicer in person.

[Both emitters on Turbo](https://imgur.com/tsiBIee)

The hidden low modes are unfortunately short of being able to be called moonlight modes at 10 lumens, however the flood light comes real close to moonlight in that mode.  If I woke up in the middle of the night in pitch blackness and turned it on, even that would be a little too much though.  Seems like it would be great for night hiking where you don't need tons of light, but it ain't no sub-lumen dark vision.

The optics would be easy to switch if other optics of that size could be found, and if it had been green tint, I could have thrown a minus green filter in there pretty easily too.

I obviously like the light.  I don't have any real complaints about it, except that I bought it about 30 minutes before being informed that there was a 20% off BLF coupon (BLF-1 for those interested).

440,"Got done with an emitter swap on my S1R II Baton, used a filed down Convoy S2+ DTP board with a 90CRI Nichia 219B 5700k emitter.

I got far too involved with actually doing it that I didn't take any photos apart from the filed down DTP board installed in the light itself, and it was a bit of work filing down the edges of the board to fit but once it was done it went in smoothly.

https://i.imgur.com/gcIAOfk.jpg

Most people have reduced the thickness of the board itself to compensate for the extremely thin stock board that comes in the S1R II, I chose to file down the white plastic cup the TIR lens sits in instead. It allowed the TIR to sit flush with the emitter board and the opening was _just_ the right size for the whole emitter to sit within the lens. Fully assembled the bezel ring sits flush without any gaps. Nice! Of course I forgot to center the ring. A minor detail, but if it bothers me enough over time I'll end up fixing it.

One thing of note is that it gets *very* hot now compared to stock. Running it on turbo the head gets near D4 levels of hot after some 30-40 seconds. Not hot enough to burn, but extremely uncomfortable to hold near the head. Given it's a marginally noticeable bump between high and turbo and doesn't get nearly as hot nearly as quickly when on high, I'll limit turbo to quick blips here and there.

**Switch Type**:  Am used to a tail switch, whatever is going to get accidentally triggered the least in a holster type setup.

445,"So I've been sitting in Excel for the last half an hour trying to work this out - I was writing a response to /u/TheGhostLP regarding CRI and apparent brightness (eg. D18 with SST-20 4000K vs 5000K - 10k lumens vs 14k lumens), and it got me thinking: If 4x the lumens is twice the apparent brightness, then a more moderate increase must be a percentage of that.

Following on from there, I started working on the basis of 10k being ""1"" and 40k being ""2"" - while ""lumens needed to appear twice as bright"" is a straight line, it feels like *percentage apparent increase* must be a curve - but I can't verify that, nor work it out right now.

Has anyone made a calculator for this? I feel like I'm trying to do a plot graph on three axes - actual lumens, percentage increase (actual lumens), and an unknown *(from 0% increase to 100% increase).

475,"Got a nice package today.. the sofirn c01 is so good, I ordered backups.. the blacks are 5600k and the reds are 3200k. Black warm was sold out already. At least it is easy to discern them now. Love these.

The SF14 NW is pretty neutral at ca. 5600k and I really like it. Altough I like slightly warmer tints these days it is not too cool and just right and has a very pleasant very neutral tint. With a slight pink/purple hue at the edges on a white wall, which actually looks nice. No green or blue visible on my specimen. Nice. It is just getting dark now and I will write a thorough review about it on the weekend after a few nights of use. With clear reflector it is quite a bit throwy for a 14500/AA and the beam is very nice. Hotspot but not too defined close up. I like that it always starts at an all around usable low which is bright enough to see a lot and will preserve energy for the higher modes. Clearly no moon with the 14500, but as this is a light with clear reflector, it has other priorities than going for a pee and not waking up the baby. The UI is just as nice and simple as it can get. Low mid high and no blinking. Good work, camping and walk outside light. 

Got it around 15 euro for the light with 14500 and charger.

I made this thing when I was 15.  I had bought the Zippo and promptly broken the flint wheel, so I gutted it and put a push button where the flint wheel was, stuck a cool white 10mm LED where the wick was, and shoved a tiny 137mAh LiPoly cell in the reservoir.  By the way, the last time that battery was charged was around 2006.  I'm frankly amazed that it's still working, though I haven't tested the voltage yet.  Not sure what LED it is, but it likely came from Radio Shack as that's where I was working at the time. I used a simple series resistor to limit current, on the high side of that emitter's capability to get *full power*.  At the time I would walk up to the smokers I knew, ask if they ""need a light?"", and then flip this bad boy out and guffaw at my own cleverness.  Speaking of my own cleverness, I left literally no way to charge the battery other than desoldering it every time.

The beam is impressively throwy for what it is, I might estimate 15-20cd and I have a hunch this battery ain't in tip top charge state.  Tint is what you'd expect for the time period.

491,"Hi,

I'm currently looking for a flash-light with long reach that can produce spot light with close to no spill.

I've managed to encounter Opticfire AG-75 which for now I have purchased for testing.
Currently I'm wondering if there possibility to obtain more powerful led pill for this torch? it has been advertised as a modular solution and my research has shown it uses XM-L2 White led which I believe produces 1000 lumens but more is always welcome.

My other option that I planned to purchase was Jaxman Z1 which I think uses the same Led?

I'm simply curios if that's the best I can get for light painting or if there are options to upgrade AG-75 into something more powerful.

To put more perspective to the kind of light painting I'm talking about here is a sample image:

https://cdn.fstoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/mike-kelley-real-estate-photography-710x254.jpg

The technique is used on the tree on the left to light it up and the photographer is using Lowel's GL-1 torch for that which costs an absolute fortune. I'm looking for something that can achieve similar results, I'm not looking for similar specs as this torch as I've already found out its not possible but more something like lights mentioned earlier.

Again thank you in advance for any help

I'm simply curios if that's the best I can get for light painting or if there are options to upgrade AG-75 into something more powerful.

To put more perspective to the kind of light painting I'm talking about here is a sample image:

https://cdn.fstoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/mike-kelley-real-estate-photography-710x254.jpg

The technique is used on the tree on the left to light it up and the photographer is using Lowel's GL-1 torch for that which costs an absolute fortune. I'm looking for something that can achieve similar results, I'm not looking for similar specs as this torch as I've already found out its not possible but more something like lights mentioned earlier.

Again thank you in advance for any help

Thank you for any inputs![Help Me] 18650 small EDC usb rechargeable beam thrower for ~$100"

Hi folks! A buddy of mine recently bought a new set of Milwaukee tools, and it included [this work light](https://www.homedepot.ca/product/milwaukee-tool-m18-led-work-light/1000730431). I was having some beverages with him this afternoon, and ended up playing with the light. I was *sorely* disappointed. (A Nichia 219C Emisar D4 lives on my hip). The literature claims it puts out 140 lumens. I was expecting much more out of a light that uses the same battery pack as a drill. So, naturally, we decided to rip it apart. (Sorry, I should have done some beam shots and the like, but here's a [lackluster review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHOP7sSBBD0) that should give you some idea). The light did have a rather nice warm tint, and i was pleased with the beam pattern. It looked like a generally useful work beam, a generous hotspot with lots of spill. 

Upon taking my voltmeter to the light and doing some poking and prodding, it looks like the magnificent, beastly 18V from the battery ~~is stepped down to 3V at the MPCB.~~ ~~Unacceptable!~~ (Edited before posting: so it seems like the voltage doesn't matter, and it's the amperage that makes a difference in what the output is of an LED. Still, i see a 3V LED that can do something like 1400 lumens, there should be no reason this thing does a tenth of that stock.)

Our first natural step, of course, was to skip the board and directly wire the battery to the MPCB. Sadly, this fried the LED without the bright flash and smoke I was expecting. (considering the above edit, this now totally makes sense.)

Then I took the unit entirely apart, and took some photos. Since we already broke it, my friend kindly offered to give it to me to try to upgrade. This thread is the beginning of that adventure! 

I'm not particularly experienced with flashlight mods, but I know my way around a soldering iron and simpler electronics. I could probably build a relatively simple circuit on a breadboard if I needed to. I'm hoping I might solicit some advice on my plan, and do a sanity check on my plans. 

What I've got to work with: 

* I'm hoping to skip the factory board entirely, as the battery seems to provide 18V without anything attached. 
* I'd like to keep the switch, it's a fairly simple clicky switch that fits into the trigger part of the plastic mould. From my understanding, most drivers meant for P60 light should work with a regular clicky switch. 
* Available power should be 18V at 10+ amps - this thing uses batteries that run impact drills and circular saws. So much potential! 
* The head of the light is aluminum, and the old MPCB was attached with thermal paste, so heat dissipation should be no problem. 

My goals: 

* Replace the driver board and MPCB with something that is drastically more powerful, and takes advantage of more of the available power. 
* Amuse myself in doing so, and have a light that makes me giggle. 

The questions: 

* I am assuming at this point that I'll need a buck driver capable of taking an 18v input (along [these lines](http://www.mtnelectronics.com/index.php?route=product/product&amp;path=67_115&amp;product_id=525)), and an LED module rated for the same output voltage as the driver. Is there anything else I might need? 
* It looks like most drivers appear to require heat sinking. I'm not sure yet how I'm going to do that, because clearly that means they cannot be mounted in the handle. It looks like I may be able to finagle a smaller one into another spot on the top housing. I guess that's my problem - maybe I can hack apart an aluminum heatsink from a computer processor and cram it in the handle. 
* Is there such a thing as a driver+LED combo board that I could mount and be done with it? I have my doubts, but it's worth asking. 
* The mounting holes on the MPCB are centered at 20mm apart. Does that imply that I need a 20mm MPCB to replace it, or should I use the diameter of the entire board, at about 25mm? (It looks like this may be irrelevant, as Mountain Electronics seems to have 20mm MPCBs as their largest option). 
* Are there any suggestions to maximize output? With the battery and form factor, I can dump 5+ amps into a 12V LED, but without reading individual data sheets I can't easily determine which LEDs can handle higher amperage, or which have the highest output. I'm happy to dig through dozens of data sheets, but if you have any suggestions I'd love to hear them. It also seems like Mountain Electronics isn't really obvious in listing the voltage of an LED. Is there some secret to this I'm missing?

My kindest thanks for your reading, and your thoughts!

2- battery life that can get me through a workday of periodic use 
3- can light up an attic, crawlspace or ceiling when on lifts
4- hardhat and head compatible

[RovyVon](https://bestlight.io/collections/rovyvon) has taken r/flashlight by storm. We here at [Best Light](https://bestlight.io) would like to offer our friends here a good deal. We just got our first shipments in recently. Now that our stock is settled, the sale begins! Just use DEBUTCELEBRATE at checkout, and you'll get 20% off your total of anything in our catalog.

Some suggestions I'd like to make are:

* [RovyVon A8](https://bestlight.io/products/rovyvon-a8) - In two flavors, the A8 uses a Nichia 219C LED for the front and three side LEDs in its transparent body. The A8U has neutral white, red and ultraviolet LEDs while the A8Y uses amber, red and blue LEDs on its side. It has a **built-in lithium polymer battery,** recharged through a Micro-USB port, so that'll turn Zak and some others away I think. But for others, the A8 is a flashlight that brings something new and interesting to the table. With three LEDs on the side, these lights are going to make a lot of peoples' lives easier and more fun.

* [Fenix CL26R](https://bestlight.io/products/fenix-cl26r) - Available in your choice of red or green, the CL26R is a rechargeable lantern that can shoot 400 lumens all around up to 25 meters away. The light can also be shot forward or down, illuminating the path ahead in three ways. The CL26R is powered by 1 replaceable 18650 battery (2600mAh battery included with every purchase), charged through a Micro-USB port.

* [Nitecore F1](https://bestlight.io/products/nitecore-f1) - Still in stock with Best Light in limited numbers, the F1 is a one-slot charger that allows you to use an 18650 as a power bank, recharging on the go. It is slim, portable, and can go anywhere you wish. Just be careful not to lose any cords!

* [Fenix TK75](https://bestlight.io/products/fenix-tk75-2018) - This powerhouse of a light can shoot up to 5100 lumens out to 850 meters, showing off nearly everything between where you're standing, where the football stadium ends, and the sidelines. It isn't often we give this out, but this TK75 earns our nickname of Light Cannon handily! New to the product, the battery holder can charge the 4 18650s (sold separately) used to power the 4 CREE XHP35 HI LEDs.

* And if you don't think any of these fit your wants now, take a look at [our catalog](https://bestlight.io/collections/all) in its entirety! I'm sure you'll find something that intrigues you.

I'm a security guard in Australia who predominately works 1800 to 0600 and I was wondering if anyone could point me towards an upgrade. I'm using an Arlec torch as my primary light source at the moment and it has from memory.

Refocusable lens
Rechargeable battery
High mode, low mode, strobe mode
400 lumens (apparently)
About 75-100 metres range 
""8 hours continuous use battery"" which really lasts more like 3

My main requirements is that it can't be huge, past a certain length it's considered a baton here because we are idiots. Long battery life and somehow still being light are favourable.

My max budget would probably be $200-$300 aid

I looked for a primer here, but I dont see one, could one of you guys point me in a direction?  Ive seen threads talking about counterfeit Samsungs.... so Im paying attention, somewhat.

**Price Range**: Would like to keep it under $60 including battery if possible. Have chargers already.

**Purpose**:  EDC. Occasional supplemental light for photography. Occasional fishing, camping, etc. 

**Battery Type &amp; Quantity**:  18650 is fine, not particular so long as it is easy to carry every day.

**Size**:  Smaller is better for EDC 

**Type**:  Handheld  

**Main Use**:  Prefer a pocket clip. Most frequent use is finding things around the house, shed, or car; getting around the house at night without turning on the main lights and waking everybody up; lighting up dark alleys, back yards, parking lots, etc. Other occasional uses as already specified.

**Switch Type**:  Side or tail click, not really particular but slight preference for side click.

**Anything Else?**:  A high CRI is fairly important to me since I do occasionally use my EDC to help light up photograph subjects. I don't like cold white and prefer something closer to 4500X-5500K. The brighter the turbo, the better. My last EDC had orange peel reflector which is really nice because I don't like hard edged bright spots. I don't want a USB charge port on the flashlight because I don't want to worry about water getting in it when I take it fishing, etc. My last EDC had a super-dim firefly mode which was really handy for not waking the wife up while stumbling into bed late at night, and I would really like something with a similar function. Perhaps a glow-in-the-dark O-ring would fill this purpose? I have never used one so I don't know how well that would work, but I'm open to suggestions.

572,"Hey guys I'm currently carrying a streamlight microstream, but am looking to upgrade and was hoping for some recommendations.

What I like about my microstream is:
 
Deep carry. The end of the light is basically flush with my pocket, and I would like my replacement to not stick out either.

Size. It's small enough that I don't notice it in my pocket, and have no trouble getting past it into my pocket. 

Tail switch. I hate twistys, and prefer tail switches to side switches.


The only thing I don't like is that it only has one mode. While 45 lumens is honestly enough for me 99% of the time I wish it had a higher output mode as well just incase I need it. 


Other requirements for my new light. 

Ability to turn on directly into a low power mode so I don't wreak my night vision if I turn on my light.

Turns off without cycling through all modes

I need to be able to carry a spare battery(I carry a spare aaa in my wallet, but should probably get a bettery locker) 

I'd prefer to spend 50ish or less

USB rechargeable would be awsome, but definitely not a requirement.

587,"Hello Fellow Flashlight nerds :)

im looking for a recommendations on a replacement for my trusty maglite. 

i want it to be solid like a maglite with in-built charging.
no really requirement on lumen's.
price limit is 300 aud.

i found a Fenix TK65R which looks nice but maybe there is something better ?

also note i am in Australia so i might not be able to get some flashlights.

Thanks

610,"So I was reading BLF the other night and came across a post by Djozz where he described slicing the dome off a 90 CRI 4000k Samsung 351D. He said it dropped the tint below the BBL (giving it a pinkish glow and completely ridding it of the green hue this emitter seems to have), dropped the color temperature to 3400k, and generally seemed overly pleased with how it turned out. I decided to give it a shot but with one of the 5000k 'dogfart' emitters. 


I [found a washer](https://imgur.com/Cgaiqjs) (sorry in advance for the quality of these pics) in my garage that was 35 thousandths thick and sanded it a bit so it would fit in between the solder pads on the MCPCB, took a fresh razor blade and very gently cut through the dome using the washer as a guide. I was left with something that looked like [this](https://imgur.com/AQrVVhS). I did not sand it or touch up the emitter in any way after slicing.


I put everything back together and [here is what it looks like](https://imgur.com/2Njl3jQ) compared to my Q8 with 5000k dogfart emitters that still have their dome on.

I'll have to test it outside this evening but so far shining it around the house I can't recommend this enough if you're a tint snob and don't mind an ~18% drop in lumens.

The reason these deals will be so short lived is because most of them will be under what the manufacturer's minimum pricing is, if they find out my supplier or myself can get in trouble. There will be a countdown timer on the deal so you guys have time to buy before I take it down.

618,"With two fantastic (and alarmingly similar looking) new soda can flashlights being announced at almost the same time, I'm curious to hear which one you'd prefer and why, based upon the available info we have.  
 
Both flashlights will be using the SST-20 95CRI 4000K emitters. The Emisar should produce 14000 lumens and the Astrolux is slated to just squeak ahead with 15000 lumens. I'm not sure on throw figures for the Astrolux but the Emisar will be reaching out over 500m which is very impressive.
  
The Emisar will be a little bit more compact and pocketable. The Astrolux might be able to hold a higher sustained brightness due to having more mass and surface area, but we don't have specs for either flashlight regarding sustained performance yet.  
  
The Emisar uses 3 18650 cells and the Astrolux uses 4. On paper, the Astrolux should have considerably longer run time, however I have heard that the Emisar runs the cells in parallel and the Astrolux runs the cells in series. I'm not an expert on electrical science, but I believe that running cells in parallel should give you longer run times. It will be interesting to find out what effects these choices have on each flashlight.  
  
The Emisar D18 runs Ramping iOS V3 like the D4S does, however it doesn't have auxiliary LEDs. The Astrolux MF01S might be running Anduril, however there's currently a bug with the thermal regulation. If this is not resolved before the flashlight goes into production, then NarsilM will most likely be used instead. The Astrolux has got an auxiliary LED board designed by Lexel installed stock.

668,"Since joining this community a bit over a year ago, there are a quite a few flashlights that I have bought, and a handful which I have really grown to love. The UltraTac K18 v2017 with a Nichia 219C emitter is one of them. I have carried this tiny but powerful flashlight for a long time now, so when I heard that a new 2019 version was available, I had to buy it.

I purchased mine from HK Equipment's eBay store [(UK link)](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/UltraTac-K18-v-2019-SS-Stainless-Steel-USB-Rechargeable-Torch-10440-Diffuser-Cap/163545641458?_trkparms=aid%3D111001%26algo%3DREC.SEED%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D56924%26meid%3D3bbc266f2a824c2197240bd282e389dd%26pid%3D100675%26rk%3D1%26rkt%3D15%26sd%3D163545641458%26itm%3D163545641458&amp;_trksid=p2481888.c100675.m4236&amp;_trkparms=pageci%3Afa0d230a-45db-11e9-a916-74dbd180b55a%7Cparentrq%3A7915e0291690ab66b3f7395bffe6a3b8%7Ciid%3A1), [(US link)](https://www.hkequipment.net/product-p/utk18ss.htm) for the very reasonable sum of £23, which I believe is less than I paid for the older version. The flashlight came with a 10440 cell, a diffuser and a USB charging module included in the price. It also has a slot for a tritium vial in the tail. The trit was not included, but I couldn't resist buying and installing one. I've been wanting to get something with a trit in it for so long...

[v2017 in the foreground, v2019 in the background](https://i.redd.it/bgljeiztmyl21.jpg)

The appearance and operation of the new model is largely unchanged. The button retains its slightly unusual UI and the outputs and runtimes are identical. You need to hold the button in order to turn the light on and off, and single clicks while on will cycle to the next mode (low, medium, high). Double click while on gives you a strobe, and double click while off enables/disables lockout. Holding to turn on and off may be a deal breaker for some people. It took me a little while to get used to it, but on the plus side it is very hard to accidentally activate this flashlight in a pocket.

The most major change to the body is the remodeled rear end. The K18 v2019 can tail stand! This is a feature I really wished for when carrying the older model with the curved loop, so I'm glad that I can now ceiling bounce the new one hands free.

[v2017 \(left\) has a fixed loop on the tail. v2019 \(right\) has a redesigned flat tail with a tritium slot \(trit not included\). Notice the additional length of the v2019 due to the installed charging module between the head and body.](https://i.redd.it/alodgxtooyl21.jpg)

There is one feature of the new version that is even more of a game changer than the ability to tail stand. Included in the package is a little micro USB charging module. Unlike the old version of this where you had to remove the head and replace it entirely with a screw on USB port, the new version's charger can be left installed between the head and body and the flashlight will continue to function. You still need to remove the head to access the USB port, but you no longer have to carry around a separate piece in order to charge on the go. The USB port is hidden safely behind an O-ring, so it should remain watertight as long as the flashlight is securely screwed together. If you dislike the extra length this adds, you can simply leave it uninstalled. One important thing to note; this is for Li-Ion cells only. Do not try to charge AAA cells with it! I have no idea what will happen but the manual said ""no"", and I will choose to obey.

[Micro USB charging module in action. The light turns green when charging is complete. It's incredible just how much more viable my 10440 cell is for heavier EDC use now that I can recharge on the go. Of course, scrounging AAA cells from TV remotes is still a viable option with this flashlight too...](https://i.redd.it/5tw88y6xryl21.jpg)

Here's a lifehack for you: Use some heat-shrink (or glue) to secure a small magnet to your pocket clip. Your flashlight can now be angled to point at almost anything in the room as long as you have something metal to attach to. I copied this mod from someone just a few weeks ago and it's probably the most useful thing I have ever done to a flashlight. Way more versatile than a magnet on the tail.

[Just ignore the dust. Spring cleaning time is due.](https://i.redd.it/piv0adestyl21.jpg)

A quick note on some specs:

Available with a cool white Cree emitter of some kind, or a neutral white Nichia 219C. I'd strongly recommend the Nichia over the Cree as both options appear to have the same output. The 219C's tint is consistent across both of my K18s; roughly 4500K and slightly rosy. The best tints I have ever owned. High CRI too!

&amp;#x200B;

[Back of the box. This is from my v2017 review, but the specs are unchanged. An interesting thing to note is that the 80 lumen level for this flashlight lasts 3x as long as the 80 lumen level on a Nichia 219C Lumintop Tool. Efficient!](https://i.redd.it/g9mntvo1vyl21.png)

So there we have it, my new favourite EDC item. Here's a TL;DR of why you should buy one:

* Extremely slim in the pocket.
* Powerful for its size.
* Efficient. Long runtime unless you have fun blasting it on the 370 lumen mode a lot.
* Dual fuel - run on 10440 or the more common AAA cells.
* Recharge on the go.
* Tritium slot in the tail. Everyone loves tritium.
* It's uncommon. You rarely seem to hear about the K18, and I have never encountered anyone else who owns the Nichia version. It's a hidden gem.

I don't often write reviews. This whole thing just kind of evolved from me posting a picture of it to be honest. I hope at least someone out there finds this informative! For further reading, here's my old [K18 v2017 review](https://imgur.com/a/zELZ6p1) which contains plenty of information that's still relevant to the new version.","[NLD] UltraTac K18 v2019 (Nichia 219C - 90CRI, ~4500K, 370lm)",flashlight,"Since joining this community a bit over a year ago, there are a quite a few flashlights that I have bought, and a handful which I have really grown to love.

I purchased mine from HK Equipment's eBay store [(UK link)](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/UltraTac-K18-v-2019-SS-Stainless-Steel-USB-Rechargeable-Torch-10440-Diffuser-Cap/163545641458?_trkparms=aid%3D111001%26algo%3DREC.SEED%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D56924%26meid%3D3bbc266f2a824c2197240bd282e389dd%26pid%3D100675%26rk%3D1%26rkt%3D15%26sd%3D163545641458%26itm%3D163545641458&amp;_trksid=p2481888.c100675.m4236&amp;_trkparms=pageci%3Afa0d230a-45db-11e9-a916-74dbd180b55a%7Cparentrq%3A7915e0291690ab66b3f7395bffe6a3b8%7Ciid%3A1), [(US link)](https://www.hkequipment.net/product-p/utk18ss.htm) for the very reasonable sum of £23, which I believe is less than I paid for the older version. The flashlight came with a 10440 cell, a diffuser and a USB charging module included in the price. It also has a slot for a tritium vial in the tail. The trit was not included, but I couldn't resist buying and installing one. I've been wanting to get something with a trit in it for so long...

The appearance and operation of the new model is largely unchanged. The button retains its slightly unusual UI and the outputs and runtimes are identical. You need to hold the button in order to turn the light on and off, and single clicks while on will cycle to the next mode (low, medium, high). Double click while on gives you a strobe, and double click while off enables/disables lockout. Holding to turn on and off may be a deal breaker for some people. It took me a little while to get used to it, but on the plus side it is very hard to accidentally activate this flashlight in a pocket.

The most major change to the body is the remodeled rear end. The K18 v2019 can tail stand! This is a feature I really wished for when carrying the older model with the curved loop, so I'm glad that I can now ceiling bounce the new one hands free.

[v2017 \(left\) has a fixed loop on the tail. v2019 \(right\) has a redesigned flat tail with a tritium slot \(trit not included\). Notice the additional length of the v2019 due to the installed charging module between the head and body.](https://i.redd.it/alodgxtooyl21.jpg)

There is one feature of the new version that is even more of a game changer than the ability to tail stand. Included in the package is a little micro USB charging module. Unlike the old version of this where you had to remove the head and replace it entirely with a screw on USB port, the new version's charger can be left installed between the head and body and the flashlight will continue to function. You still need to remove the head to access the USB port, but you no longer have to carry around a separate piece in order to charge on the go. The USB port is hidden safely behind an O-ring, so it should remain watertight as long as the flashlight is securely screwed together. If you dislike the extra length this adds, you can simply leave it uninstalled. One important thing to note; this is for Li-Ion cells only. Do not try to charge AAA cells with it! I have no idea what will happen but the manual said ""no"", and I will choose to obey.

[Micro USB charging module in action. The light turns green when charging is complete. It's incredible just how much more viable my 10440 cell is for heavier EDC use now that I can recharge on the go. Of course, scrounging AAA cells from TV remotes is still a viable option with this flashlight too...](https://i.redd.it/5tw88y6xryl21.jpg)

Here's a lifehack for you: Use some heat-shrink (or glue) to secure a small magnet to your pocket clip. Your flashlight can now be angled to point at almost anything in the room as long as you have something metal to attach to. I copied this mod from someone just a few weeks ago and it's probably the most useful thing I have ever done to a flashlight. Way more versatile than a magnet on the tail.

[Just ignore the dust. Spring cleaning time is due.](https://i.redd.it/piv0adestyl21.jpg)

A quick note on some specs:

Available with a cool white Cree emitter of some kind, or a neutral white Nichia 219C. I'd strongly recommend the Nichia over the Cree as both options appear to have the same output. The 219C's tint is consistent across both of my K18s; roughly 4500K and slightly rosy. The best tints I have ever owned. High CRI too!

&amp;#x200B;

[Back of the box. This is from my v2017 review, but the specs are unchanged. An interesting thing to note is that the 80 lumen level for this flashlight lasts 3x as long as the 80 lumen level on a Nichia 219C Lumintop Tool. Efficient!](https://i.redd.it/g9mntvo1vyl21.png)

So there we have it, my new favourite EDC item. Here's a TL;DR of why you should buy one:

* Extremely slim in the pocket.
* Powerful for its size.
* Efficient. Long runtime unless you have fun blasting it on the 370 lumen mode a lot.
* Dual fuel - run on 10440 or the more common AAA cells.
* Recharge on the go.
* Tritium slot in the tail. Everyone loves tritium.
* It's uncommon. You rarely seem to hear about the K18, and I have never encountered anyone else who owns the Nichia version. It's a hidden gem.

I don't often write reviews. This whole thing just kind of evolved from me posting a picture of it to be honest. I hope at least someone out there finds this informative!

677,"Hello all, first post here. I've always liked the olight brand, and had never had a good rechargeable flashlight, so I jumped on the valentine's day sale to pick up a titanium S1R ii summer CW, and I really love a lot of things about it. The UI is awesome, the beam is super nice, the magnetic charging is great, and the turbo mode is impressively bright for such a small light. 

But there are some things I don't like about it, so I'm considering returning it to amazon and replacing it with a different light. The battery life isn't great. I use the light for walking the dog around the neighborhood and I find that medium is not quite bright enough, and going to high or turbo put a big strain on the battery, because even in short bursts, those modes always start above the sustained lumen output, so you're really lowering your runtime in either of those boosted modes if you're turning the light on and off as I do. I think I'd like a light that has a reasonably bright, sustained / non-boosted mode, so I can get a consistent run time on that mode. Seeing as I'm not carrying the light every day (I carry a lot of other crap), I figure I may as well just get an 18650 light that will run for several hours at a sustained 400-500 lumens, rather than having to keep boosting the S1R to 600 lumens (high) which ends up eating up half my battery life on a quick dog walk. 

The TC15 would seem to be the obvious choice due to the power output, but I really really like the magnetic tailcap on my S1R... I find I'm using the low modes in the house at night, and in the bathroom brushing my teeth at night with the magnet stuck to the ceiling lighting, so the bright room lights don't wake me up. The S30R iii and S2R ii aren't much heavier than my Ti S1R, so I assume the magnets would be just as useful on those? As well, the TC15 mode spread doesn't seem as ideal as the S30R iii and S2R ii - 250 lumen medium is high for inside at night, but you'd probably want more outside, and then 1000 lumen sustained is awesome outside, but your runtime goes to an hour and a half, versus 120 lumen medium on the olights for 15ish hours is good indoors, and sustained 400-500 lumens seems to be a good practical brightness for the trade off in 3.5-4 hours of battery life...?

I'm leaning towards the S30R iii, even though its older, because I think the more focused reflector beam with good spill may still be good indoors at lower settings, but give me considerably more reach and higher perceived brightness than the S1R-like S2R ii TIR... I also like the magnetic charger station, as I'd keep it plugged in on my nightstand... Sorry for the rambling post, just wondering if anyone has any thoughts on the S30R iii, S2R ii, TC15, or anything comparable?","Trade S1R ii for S30R iii, S2R ii, TC15, or... what?",flashlight,"Hello all, first post here.

682,"So basically, I need a multi purpose flashlight, and for some dumb reason i decided to buy something expensive, but that prominently scales with reliability, function, and certain features. I need a very tight cone, decent throw, fairly long lasting, and so that the temperature spectrum is right about the middle. I can't stand very cool or warm color. Weight i don't care. 1k lumens sounds about right, and as many light modes as possible.  And finally to be around 6-10 inches in length.

I've never owned anything like this and never ended up overpaying for a flashlight lol, but I was almost set on T20R Fenix. It doesn't seem like they ask for outrageous prices, their specs are good, and people seem to be happy with them. However, it seems like people describe it as mostly a cool light, which is a big no no.

Now there seem to be these fancy shmancy MILITARY/POLICE flashlights with ""badass"" names and super expensive, but i would admit that despite cringing a little, I do kind of presume they make a difference due to different level of standards and demands in the line of professional applications. Something tells me though the pricing is to reflect milking from government contracts...

I took a look at Surefire, Streamlight, Overready, HDS, and Malkoff Devices, and I am kind of leaning towards something from Malkoff. Overready, Okluma, and HDS, kind of made me chuckly tbh... That is some crazy hipster stuff.

There is also Elzette, and it is somehow related to Malkoff?!

690,"Hey fellow flashlight enthusiasts! I just got my Acebeam T27 in the mail. It's awesome in every way but one. Even though it technically uses USB C for charging (yay), I can only get it to charge using USB A to C cables. No luck with USB C to C cables like my phone or laptop use. Is my unit defective or did Acebeam implement the USB C standard incorrectly?

Here's what I've tested so far:

* Acebeam included ""special"" USB A(male+female) to USB C cable - works as advertised
* USB A (male) to USB C cable - Light charges
* USB C to USB A (female) - Light behaves as a power bank
* USB C to USB C - No charging indicator on the light when plugged into a power source. Light behaves as a power bank when plugged into phone.

I've tried multiple USB C power sources, with and without the Power Delivery standard and multiple USB C cables. No luck. I **love** that Acebeam is leading the pack and adopting USB C, but unless I got a dud, it looks like they need to take another look at the USB standard.  :(

**Anyone have a T27 they can test with a USB C charger?**

**Edit:** It looks like the [Acebeam H30 may have this same issue](http://budgetlightforum.com/node/63182), as well as the [Acebeam E65](https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/93e2ep/light_that_charges_with_a_usb_c_to_c_cable/). I bought this light to reduce the number of cables I need to keep track of. Now I need a USB C cable, a USB A to C cable, AND a Micro USB to USB A cable for the older gadgets? *Lame* /u/acebeam. *So close yet so far.* I'm not sure I trust this thing as a power bank or to charge without supervision if it's not adhering to the USB standard correctly.

**Edit2**: When plugged into my phone using a USB C to C cable, the light indicates that it's in powerbank mode but it doesn't actually charge the phone. Sigh.

**Edit3:** Just heard back from Acebeam. They say the light should only be charged using their ""special"" USB C cable. If anyone is searching for a USB C light and comes across this post, DON'T BUY THIS ONE. The Acebeam T27 doesn't meet USB-C specifications and could be dangerous to you, the light, or the device being charged by the light. Buyer beware!

699,"This is the Zebralight H600d mark IV high CRI in 5000k. I was looking for a headlamp with a good combination of throw and flood. With the extreme floodiness of the Armytek Wizard Pro, I found myself carrying two lights in crawlspaces. 

Here are some miscellaneous thoughts with a couple albums at the bottom.

Zebralight is smaller and lighter so its a little more comfortable on the head. Their headband is actually wider so it seems to offer more support. The light is not as easily removable from the headband as the AT. Good thing is, it fits in the AT headband just fine.

I prefer the UI of the Z but neither is a dealbreaker. The walls of the tube on the AT feel slightly thicker. Generally, the AT seems more robustly built. Ive beaten the snot out of mine and it hasn't missed a beat. The Z also seems well built. Just not as 'can also be a hammer' like the AT.

I prefer the switch on the Z. It just feels better. Slightly more forgiving than the AT.  Furthermore since its in the top center of the head of the light, its a little more easily indexed.

Nitpicks: 
I can hear the battery (samsung 30q) rattle against the inside walls of the light when I smack it against something.

Would have like a slightly stiffer spring but Im not sure why.

Conclusion: 

Overall Im satisfied with the build quality and performance of this light. Only time will tell how it really measures up. This is a work light so it will be put through its paces without mercy.

I think Zebralight is a good light that can be purchased with confidence.  That being said I think they are overpriced and have achieved kind of a cult of personality, if not  slightly mythical status.

Would appreciate any suggestions. I realize this is probably very similar to a lot of the requests you get.  I tried Parametrek but everything that came up as blink:none ended up having a strobe mode that wasn't hidden enough for my needs. Looked at EagTac PX30LC2DR and the AceBeam EC65 219C, but they seem to have strobe modes that are too easy to access.  


**Purpose** \- For work. Need to replace my beloved FourSevens Quark Click QK2L-X that was destroyed. Considering something similar, or maybe upgrading. I have a technical job that is 90% looking in equipment racks and under things, 10% ""Hey what is that thing way up on the ceiling of this warehouse?""

**Size** \- Don't really care. I guess I would like it small enough to carry on my belt.

**Battery Type &amp; Quantity** \- Either 2xCR123, or any kind of rechargable with a built in charger. Work will pay for CR123s. I guess my main thing is that I don't want to burn the house down.

**Price Range** \- &lt; $250 USD. Willing to pay if I can get more of my requirements, but I'm happy to pay less.

**Type** \- Handheld.

**Lumens** \- I guess my old FourSevens claimed something like 800 lumens on the highest setting? I guess that's sufficient. Also a low mode.

**Switch Type** \- Tail switch.

**Anything Else**? - Hard requirement is either no strobe mode, strobe that I effectively disable, or *maybe* is very, **extremely** hidden. Triple click, press-and-hold for 3 seconds, or loosen this thing, etc isn't hidden enough. I really only use a semi-low mode and a very high mode. I'm fine if it is hideously complex to set up or program, I just don't want a lot of complexity on a day-to-day basis. High CRI would be nice. I guess I'd like it to be at least water resistant in case I go out in the rain.

I know EBL batteries aren't popular among those with any knowledge, but I didn't have any knowledge back in 2017 when I ordered [some EBL 18650s, advertised as 3000 mAh cells](https://i.imgur.com/coG5PZm.jpg).

I actually ordered the cells by accident in a shopping fugue, thinking I was ordering lithium ion AAs.  When they came in the mail I realized my mistake, but the return shipping made it not worth the money and time to return them, so they sat on my shelf for a couple years.

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago when I discovered this sub and ordered some lights.  Lo and behold, I already had some 18650s lying around, so I thought, 'Great, I could just use these!'

Fortunately I also ordered an analyzing charger, the [LiitoKala Lii-500](http://lygte-info.dk/review/Review%20Charger%20LiitoKala%20Lii-500%20UK.html), and decided to run a 'NOR test' on the EBL batteries (i.e., the charger fully charges the cell, discharges it, and recharges to measure capacity).

All four of the cells came in at around 2200 mAh.  Here are the results:

After doing some more research, I've learned these EBL batteries are really just rebranded Ultrafires, and if I'd known better, I would've recognized them as junk and avoided them.

747,"I was feeling a little nostalgic the other day. As a child, perhaps the first flashlight I ever witnessed was a little black AA Mini Maglite that we had laying around the house. I have fond memories of playing with that thing, but unfortunately it has been missing for many years now and I have no idea what ever happened to it. After seeing one that was really cheap on Amazon, I decided to purchase it and relive my infant days. After travelling back to the year 1997, I decided to write a short review of it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Build:**

The flashlight feels good in the hand. The machining is very smooth and the knurling has just enough grip to provide traction without feeling like it's going to wear out your pockets, which is good news as the rest of the flashlight is very smooth and will likely be hard to hold onto securely with greasy or wet hands. The threads screw smoothly, however it's worth noting that the batteries can rattle a little bit if you shake or tap the flashlight. Not really worth complaining about in my opinion though. IPX4 waterproofness and 1 metre drop distance ratings should ensure that this Mini Maglite will stand up to the harshest of environments and usage.

&amp;#x200B;

**Size:**

This is excellently sized for EDC. It's a little long for some pockets, but very slim and will disappear alongside a wallet. The addition of a deep carry clip could make this one of the most compact EDC options on the market.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bulb:**

This flashlight utilizes one of Maglite's own Xenon bulbs to produce a 14 lumen focusable beam of light that can reach out up to 96 metres. And it can do that for over 5 hours on a single pair of AA batteries too. That's some impressive performance for such a tiny little thing! I must admit that there's a tiny bit of a donut hole in the middle of the beam, but you can make it go away if you focus the flashlight just right. I think I can forgive that when I see just how nice the tint is. It's a slightly rosy \~3000K tint, and the CRI is 100, which is fantastic! Colours look so rich and vibrant under this thing. It's a pleasure to behold! The 14 lumen output is perfect too - not too bright for dark adjusted eyes, and not so dim as to be useless around other light sources.

&amp;#x200B;

**UI:**

This flashlight features a simple single mode twisty operation. Twist to turn on, and keep twisting to focus the beam. You can't get a UI any better than that. I even found a hidden mode! If you keep twisting until the head comes off, you can access candle mode which gives the flashlight the ability to tailstand and mimic a candle. It's awesome, and while you could argue that it's a bit of a gimmick, it's actually a really nice feature to have. I don't know of any other flashlights that have a candle mode, but I'd love to see it implemented more often in the future.

https://i.redd.it/ny7w7t4gtjl21.png

I found a funny looking flashlight in the kitchen drawer and decided to compare it against my new purchase. On the left we have the Mini Maglite. On the right we have the... Emissary 4D I think it was called. I'll have to check again later. I was a bit alarmed the first time I turned it on because it went super bright and got really hot. I turned it off and took the battery out (not sure what it is - it's wider than an AA but thinner than a C). When I finally dared to put the battery back in, it flashed a couple of times and now the output seems to have stabilised. Must have been a short circuit or something.

Compared to the Maglite, the 4D has a very harsh white beam. I'd estimate it at around 5000K, which is very cold and unforgiving on the eyes. I'm concerned about how quickly it will burn through the single battery it uses, as this is an unusually high output for such a small flashlight. I reckon it's pushing out nearly 100 lumens right now, and I'm not sure where I can buy another battery for it when it will inevitably run out of power. One thing it has got going for it though - that is the smoothest beam I have ever seen. The bulbs look really weird, there are four of them shaped like little squares.  What an unusual design. I bet if I could modify this Maglite to have four bulbs, I'd have the perfect super high output, high CRI, lovely tinted pocket flashlight. Emissary might be on to something here, but their execution is flawed!

&amp;#x200B;

Example: http://www.ff-light.com/index.php?route=product/product&amp;product_id=55

From the choices for the Fireflies E07 only the 4000k SST20 lists the CRI. How am I to know the CRI for the rest of the options? How am I to know the pro's and cons of each LED option beyond color temperature? They don't even list the output in lumens from one LED option to another? 

It seems many manufacturer website are guilty of this, it makes it extremely difficult to make purchasing decisions. Thanks for any help!LED Wiki/Table/Info? XPL Hi V3, SST20, Nichia 219c so many LED options so little info?"

767,"So, I am slowly making the conversion to 18650 after seeing many suggestions from this site. As a part of that conversion, I am looking for a way to keep these lights powered long term backpacking, or in a prolonged power outage that occasionally happens in my area. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently using the following lights, and looking to add these in addition:

Thrunite TC12 (owned)

Wowtac a2s (looking to add) x2

Another high quality handheld, similar to a thrunite tn12

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I mention these so you can have a good idea on cells being used, they appear to be mostly protected, so I know that can cut down charger options.

&amp;#x200B;

Lead items I am considering. I am planning on utilizing these items with a bigblue 28w solar cell to be able to use them long term. I want the charger to be able to be charged via USB and have the ability to be used as a portable power brick in a pinch. 

&amp;#x200B;

nitecore f2: Lots of good reviews here, and I like that it can charge several different battery types. I do not like that it doesn't look super durable. I am planning on dropping this in a backpacking bag, I dont think I would be comfortable keeping the batteries in the charger, and I don't know how well the charging prongs would be protected if it were empty. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thurnite c2: looks like this item was discontinued, but you are still able to get a few of them from amazon if you purchase them in a kit with a CW temp TN12. Not what I really want to do on the color temp, but looks to be a very good deal all things considered. I like that the battery is fully enclosed. Total cost on the unit looks pretty good as well when you figure what a battery and a tn12 generally costs. Downside is that it looks like it only charges 18650, not the biggest deal since I have nothing else to use with. 

&amp;#x200B;

xtar pb2: I love the way this charger looks self contained and the rest of the features on it, it just doesn't appear to work with the protected cells that I need. Am I reading that wrong, will it work with my tech? If so, it might be my best option.

To be clear I'm not mad, just extremely curious as to the exact mechanism here. 


I just bought this brand new D4S, flashed Anduril immediately (had to try out the pins), and tossed in a Samsung 35E 18650 for light testing. I played with the aux lights for a bit, and then got to the strobes. And then I noticed it, it was loud. I could hear it clearly a foot away from my head. And what's more I could FEEL it, vibrating in my hand to the rythm of the flashes. It was crazy. I tested it with a 30Q to see if it would still do the same thing, but it didn't. I could still hear the flashes if I put it right up to my ear, same as with my D4. But with a 35E in this thing, it vibrates a lot. I tried it with 4 batteries, two 35Es one full one at 3.8v, and two 30Qs one full and one 3.8v. it only did it with the 35Es regardless of charge.



Here's the audio files, this is literally touching my phone to the light, warning they are loud:

Granted, it's not enough to see it, and if you hold it down tight to the table it kind of stops. But I handed to it my wife while it was doing it and get first word was ""oh, that's weird, that shouldn't do that, should it? ""




Here's what I think it is: ok, I don't know what's causing it. I thought it was only doing it with the 35Es because they had a different weight than the 30Qs but they weigh the same. Either way, I think it's a resonate frequency of some sort because the battery isn't shimmed, it's just lined up between the springs, free floating there.

For reference, I have an Emisar D4 that I LOVE, and I’ll carry it from time to time, but for me an 18650 is just too big for daily pocket use. I also used to have a BLF 348 before I lost it (I’ll probably replace that as well at some point, but I always wanted a 348 with a low mode).

My S1 is a little stubby as well, and I wouldn’t mind a longer/skinnier light. So I’m thinking I want a 14500 cell light, and maybe a 10440 or 2x 10440. Has to be NW, preferably high cri.

* I would LOVE a ramping UI but I don’t think I’ll find it. (The GT micro has it as a 14500 light, but I haven’t found others).
* Magnetic tail cap would be nice.
* Tail-stand would be nice.
* built in Recharging would be nice.
* I’d be okay with a bit more throw than the olight TIR.

822,"I've had my Zebralight SC62W since 2015. It has served me well and is still functioning fine, I just want another light in the rotation. I'm considering the Emisar D4 or D4S. I carry it either on my bag, clipped to some molle straps, in my front right pocket, or my rear right pocket.

&amp;nbsp;

Things I don't like about the SC62W:

* Pocket clip isn't very deep and it's very shiny.
* UI is easy for me to use, but not anyone else who uses the light (the delay from pressing the switch confuses a lot of people).
* It has lost the ""wow""/fun factor for me.

&amp;nbsp;

Things that I like about the SC62W:

* Size and weight
* Tint of the light

&amp;nbsp;

I've filled out the recommendation form below:

&gt; **Purpose** - Everyday carry, home use, office use, out in public/nature use (to carry while camping/hiking)
&gt; 
&gt; **Size** - I would like to be similar size and weight of the Zebralight SC62W, if possible.
&gt; 
&gt; **Battery Type &amp; Quantity** - Rechargeable batteries such as 18650 and for EDC, probably just 1x.
&gt; 
&gt; **Price Range** - Less than $100 perfered, but $150 would be my max (battery and light included, I already have a Nitecore D4 charger)
&gt; 
&gt; **Type** - Handheld/pocketable/deep pocket carry.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lumens** - Most lumens possible that will give me great throw (fun factor) while still having a very usable flood.
&gt; 
&gt; **Switch Type** - I'm not to particular about the switch, but the UI is important. The SC62W's UI is very confusing for someone who doesn't know how to use it. Ramping UI seems like fun and easy to use but I personally don't have any experience with it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Anything Else?** - I don't know much about CRI and color temperature, but I like that the SC62W's color doesn't really change the color of what it's illuminating. 

I'm personally leaning toward the Emisar D4 to replace my SC62W, but I don't know which emitter. I am aware that the D4 is a hotrod and I plan to either use the electronic or twist lockout. Then I was thinking of picking up the Thorfire Q8 as a car/home/campsite/bag light during nature activities light.

856,"Hi guys,  

Today received my XTAR VC4 charger and I started charging a collection of batteries right away. I have two Fenix 18650 batteries and a Lumintop 14500 battery.

Both the Fenix batteries say on the outside ""18650 3.6v 12.6Wh 3500mAh"" and the Lumintop says 750mAh 3.7v 2.8Wh""

I put all three batteries in the charger and they started charging. What struck me though is that the VC4 stopped charging both the Fenix batteries at 4.2 Volts (FULL was displayed) and the Lumintop 14500 was still charging at 4.0 Volts. Fearing this was wrong / dangerous I shut off the charger and removed the batteries. 

My question is, on the 18650 it says 3.6 Volts, now they are charged to 4.2 Volts. Is this normal or did I inadvertently overcharge these cells?

Basically the same question for the Lumintop 14500. It says 3.7 Volts but it kept on charging to 4 Volts without any sign of stopping. Is this battery being overcharged and/or am I doing something wrong?

Any help is greatly appreciated!

I was sent this light to review free of charge but, as always, I've tried to be as unbiased as possible.

*****
##TL;DR
I was pretty excited for this one. I've never reviewed or even owned a 26650 light before.  
The Sofirn SP33 is a 1x26650 side switch XHP50.2 flashlight capable of outputting 2500 lumens. The one I got came bundled with one of Sofirn's 5500mAh (not really, see battery section) 26650 cells, and a small micro USB powered charger. At $40, it's pretty cheap considering you get a boost driven light, a high capacity cell, and a charger. The build quality is as great as Sofirn's other stuff, but the beam isn't fantastic and UI leaves much to be desired. 

*****
[Album link](https://imgur.com/a/bhmJZoF)

###Packaging
The Sofirn SP33 comes in one of [Sofirn's standard boxes](https://i.imgur.com/l0RyI2D.jpg). The light is in a vaccum formed tray inside, with the accessories under the tray, and the cell in the light, with an insulating disk on the negative end.

###Contents
[The box contains](https://i.imgur.com/UatCT50.jpg):

- Sofirn SP33
- 5500mAh Sofirn branded 26650 cell
- Insulating disk
- 18650(?) adapter
- Single slot charger
- Micro USB cable
- Lanyard
- Two extra o-rings
- A silica gel packet ([top](https://i.imgur.com/CX3IXlG.jpg), [bottom](https://i.imgur.com/G6OPgYV.jpg))
- A manual ([one](https://i.imgur.com/Q9pvVav.jpg), [two](https://i.imgur.com/6ETQ3qi.jpg))

###Build
The [Sofirn SP33](https://i.imgur.com/M0GuVTq.jpg) has Sofirn's typical build quality, which is to say, it's excellent for the price. It's boasts square threads and big o-rings (both of which are aready lubed), 
smooth, smooth anodizing, and knurling that's just aggressive enough. The SP33 does seem to have more noticeable milling marks than most of Sofirn's other lights. I can see them clearly on the tailcap and head. At 128mm, it's not a whole lot longer than a tailswitch 18650 light, but it's quite a bit thicker at 37mm wide. 
This being an electronic switch light, the tailcap is just [a solid piece of aluminum with a spring in it](https://i.imgur.com/LbZgPWT.jpg). The threads are pretty shallow, only about two rotations (I'm sure there's a better word) deep, but that's probably just to keep the light as short as possible. The spring is short, fairly stiff, and gold plated.  
[The outside of the tailcap](https://i.imgur.com/nUKaSLR.jpg) has grooves milled into it that run lengthwise along the light to aid in removing the taicap. These are necessary, as a larger diameter flashlight is going to be harder to unscrew than a smaller diameter flashlight. [The bottom of the tailcap](https://i.imgur.com/8oXT19A.jpg) has two ridges on the bottom that allow it to tailstand. Unlike some of Sofirn's other lights, this is pretty stable when it tailstands. There are two holes cut into one side of the tailcap so you can attach the lanyard.  
The [body tube's threads](https://i.imgur.com/66xUm47.jpg) are thick, square cut, and pre-lubed. The o-rings are pretty beefy, and also lubricated. Again, the threads are fairly short, but this doesn't cause any problems. The body tube is reversible, which surprised me. It's not symmetrical. There's a big lip on one end that's supposed to be on the tailcap end, but I experienced no ill effects of using it the other way around. [It's a thick body tube](https://i.imgur.com/bpTMZi8.jpg). Maybe it's just because it's a 26650 light, but either way, it feels really solid. The knurling is of the typical diamond pattern, with four grooves milled into it lengthwise.  
[The head of the SP33](https://i.imgur.com/XGErEuS.jpg) has a single plastic indicating switch with a bare metal bezel around it, [some heat fins](https://i.imgur.com/LRvBWCE.jpg) around and above the switch, and [a screw-in bare metal bezel](https://i.imgur.com/P2ARff2.jpg). [Under the bezel](https://i.imgur.com/N6akAKW.jpg) is a glass lens (*not* AR), o-ring, *another* o-ring, lightly orange peeled reflector, emitter gasket, and [MCPCB](https://i.imgur.com/E82mnVS.jpg). I'm a big fan of the two o-ring design. The first o-ring is under the glass and sits in a groove in the reflector, preventing water from entering the reflector, and the second sits on a shelf just inside the head and is pressed against by the bezel, preventing water from getting around the reflector.  
[The driver spring](https://i.imgur.com/iCQwKIj.jpg) is the same as the tail spring. Big, thick, and gold plated. There is no retaining ring, which is typical for side switch lights. The driver is probably held in by the screws next to the MCPCB.  
One interesting thing about the head is that it's pentagonal. There are five flats machined into the head, as opposed to the four flats on the tailcap and four grooves in the body tube. The only reason this bothers me is because it makes it harder to get photos of the switch.  

###Lanyard
The SP33 comes with [a very basic lanyard](https://i.imgur.com/12IMvYL.jpg). There's some large string for the loop that goes around your wrist and some small string that goes in the [holes in the tailcap](https://i.imgur.com/jC7NqPT.jpg). The two strings are held together by a plastic connector. It's very generic, and [works just fine](https://i.imgur.com/wo7MbUh.jpg).  
For a light of this size, a holster would be useful. While reviewing it, I carried it in a belt holster for a week. It only turned on once, and that was after I plopped down on a bed in a weird position.

###Battery and Charging
Sofirn included a [5500mAh Sofirn branded unprotected 26650 cell](https://i.imgur.com/2Z53psz.jpg) with my SP33 (I took that photo after removing the wrapper and rewrapping the cell), along with a charger and a micro USB cable (because I don't have enough of those). They're pretty good at offering full packages like this, which is a great idea when selling on Amazon. The typical consumer won't have any li-ion cells or chargers.  
I tested the cell on my Opus BTC100, and it read closer to 5200mAh, but the internal resistance was very low, at only 29mOhms. This is comparable to a Sony VTC6. It took a 3A charge very well, only getting slightly warm to the touch. There was nothing but a bare steel tube under the wrapper, so this probably isn't a cell manufactured by one of the Big Five.  
The SP33 includes a plastic sleeve that's supposed to let you use an 18650 cell without cell rattle. In reality, [it's too large](https://i.imgur.com/X1xcbgb.jpg) on the inside to do that. The springs are stiff, but if you bump it hard enough, an 18650 cell will move. It can take protected, unprotected, flat top, and button top 18650 cells. For that reason, I assume it words with protected 26650 cells as well, but I don't have one to test it with.  
[The charger](https://i.imgur.com/EqkbUEA.jpg) is one of Sofirn's typical chargers. It's a single slot charger powered by an [included micro USB cable](https://i.imgur.com/FRCUUJO.jpg), [with some specs on the bottom](https://i.imgur.com/DTDb5cF.jpg). It charges cells at 0.75A, which is a bit slow for a 26650 cell. An indicator light changes from [red](https://i.imgur.com/VB8zbHp.jpg) to [green](https://i.imgur.com/F6DynGF.jpg) once charging is complete.  
Upon turn on, the side switch shows a light for five seconds to indicate the level of charge. Solid green means it's above 3.6V, it'll be solid red between 3.6V and 3V, and below 3V it'll flash red. The SP33 does have LVP, which is good, seeing as how the included cell is unprotected. This kicks in at 2.6V, which is a bit lower than I would have liked, but it's there. 

###Modes and UI
The SP33's UI is one of its weakest aspects.  
From off:

- Press and hold for about half a second to go to the lowest mode  
- Press to go to the memorized mode  
- Double press to go to turbo  
   
While on:

- Press and hold to cycle between Low, Med, and High.
- Press to turn off.
- When on in the lowest mode, you can't go into the main mode rotation.  
- Turbo can be accessed from any mode by double pressing. A single press takes you back to the mode you were in before.  
- Double pressing from turbo goes into strobe, which is of the fast pulse, slower pulse, fast pulse variety.
- A quad press will toggle the electronic lockout. While this is on, any presses of the button make the light flash twice.

[As you can see from the manual](https://i.imgur.com/Q9pvVav.jpg), the lowest ""Eco"" mode is fifteen whole lumens. That's way too high. That, plus the lack of freedom in the UI, bothers me immensely. I see no reason Sofirn couldn't have used one of TK's UIs (though I suppose the voltage indicatior wouldn't have functioned the same). This would be fantastic with a well made ramping UI.  
Turbo, as stated in the manual, has a timed stepdown at 2 minutes. In my testing with a full battery, this isn't really necessary. The light was still cool enough to hold comfortably after this two minutes. Even so, two minutes is a long time.  
The manual mentions temperature regulation. I don't have a good way to test this, but the temperature didn't exceed 55 degrees C while I was testing turbo timing and LVP.

###Beam and Tint
The SP33 uses a cool white (6000K to 6500K) XHP50.2 emitter. The beam has typical Cree tint shift, with a cool hotspot, yellow halo, and blue spill. If you're snobby about beams, you'll want to swap the emitter for something nicer.  
The reflector is lightly orange peeled, which probably helps eliminate any artifacts from the quad die emitter. I didn't see any artifacts in the beam. There was no noticeable PWM on any mode.  

[Beam vs 4000K 90+ CRI 219C in a Fenix UC30](https://i.imgur.com/kN7Cx44.jpg). The SP33 is a bit less green/blue in real life.

###Modding potential

**Disclaimer**: Do this stuff a your own risk. If you mess up and break something, that's on you. Also, doing any of this will totally void your warranty.

Driver: About 29.5mm
MCPCB: My calipers don't go that far down, but I'm pretty sure it's about 22mm.

This light is just begging for an emitter swap, and maybe a frosted lens. Maybe a Nichia 144A? With the OP reflector, a quad E21A setup would work. I really want to try that now.

*****
##Bottom line:
####Pros

- Cell and charger included
- Quite cheap for a boost driven light
- Good build quality

####Cons

- Tint shift
- Modes and UI
- Cell capacity is lower than stated

It's a single slot charger powered by an [included micro USB cable](https://i.imgur.com/FRCUUJO.jpg), [with some specs on the bottom](https://i.imgur.com/DTDb5cF.jpg). It charges cells at 0.75A, which is a bit slow for a 26650 cell. An indicator light changes from [red](https://i.imgur.com/VB8zbHp.jpg) to [green](https://i.imgur.com/F6DynGF.jpg) once charging is complete.  
Upon turn on, the side switch shows a light for five seconds to indicate the level of charge. Solid green means it's above 3.6V, it'll be solid red between 3.6V and 3V, and below 3V it'll flash red. The SP33 does have LVP, which is good, seeing as how the included cell is unprotected. This kicks in at 2.6V, which is a bit lower than I would have liked, but it's there. 

###Modes and UI
The SP33's UI is one of its weakest aspects.  
From off:

- Press and hold for about half a second to go to the lowest mode  
- Press to go to the memorized mode  
- Double press to go to turbo  
   
While on:

- Press and hold to cycle between Low, Med, and High.
- Press to turn off.
- When on in the lowest mode, you can't go into the main mode rotation.  
- Turbo can be accessed from any mode by double pressing. A single press takes you back to the mode you were in before.  
- Double pressing from turbo goes into strobe, which is of the fast pulse, slower pulse, fast pulse variety.
- A quad press will toggle the electronic lockout. While this is on, any presses of the button make the light flash twice.

[As you can see from the manual](https://i.imgur.com/Q9pvVav.jpg), the lowest ""Eco"" mode is fifteen whole lumens. That's way too high. That, plus the lack of freedom in the UI, bothers me immensely. I see no reason Sofirn couldn't have used one of TK's UIs (though I suppose the voltage indicatior wouldn't have functioned the same). This would be fantastic with a well made ramping UI.  
Turbo, as stated in the manual, has a timed stepdown at 2 minutes. In my testing with a full battery, this isn't really necessary. The light was still cool enough to hold comfortably after this two minutes. Even so, two minutes is a long time.  
The manual mentions temperature regulation. I don't have a good way to test this, but the temperature didn't exceed 55 degrees C while I was testing turbo timing and LVP.

###Beam and Tint
The SP33 uses a cool white (6000K to 6500K) XHP50.2 emitter. The beam has typical Cree tint shift, with a cool hotspot, yellow halo, and blue spill. If you're snobby about beams, you'll want to swap the emitter for something nicer.  
The reflector is lightly orange peeled, which probably helps eliminate any artifacts from the quad die emitter. I didn't see any artifacts in the beam. There was no noticeable PWM on any mode.  

[Beam vs 4000K 90+ CRI 219C in a Fenix UC30](https://i.imgur.com/kN7Cx44.jpg). The SP33 is a bit less green/blue in real life.

###Modding potential

**Disclaimer**: Do this stuff a your own risk. If you mess up and break something, that's on you. Also, doing any of this will totally void your warranty.

Driver: About 29.5mm
MCPCB: My calipers don't go that far down, but I'm pretty sure it's about 22mm.

This light is just begging for an emitter swap, and maybe a frosted lens. Maybe a Nichia 144A? With the OP reflector, a quad E21A setup would work. I really want to try that now.

*****
##Bottom line:
####Pros

- Cell and charger included
- Quite cheap for a boost driven light
- Good build quality

####Cons

- Tint shift
- Modes and UI
- Cell capacity is lower than stated

889,"tl;dr: is the Emisar D4S a reliable flashlight for hiking/emergency use?


r/flashlight neophyte here - the last two months with my Olight H2R have been both satisfying and... illuminating... sorry... Anyway, I've definitely got the bug now. The D4S was the next light to catch my eye. 

Based on what I understand so far, it seems like quality flashlights fit into two general categories - practical lights, which tend to be floody, tough, compact, and reasonably powerful, and ""toys"", which are certainly useful but compromise on durability, form factor, and battery life in the pursuit of throw or raw output. Please correct me if this is an oversimplification.

I happened across an old comment in this this sub that mentioned Emisar's durability/longetivity - the user made a comparison to Surefire, something to the effect that the Emisar would hold up to regular drops and dings, but wasn't exactly designed for everyday use and couldn't be counted on to last for years or to weather tough situations. Essentially, I got the impression that the D4S would be considered more of a ""toy"".

Is this a mischaracterization? The D4S appealed to me based on its output, size, and visibly sublime build quality, so I was surprised to hear doubt cast on its practicality. More generally, which brands or models should I look at if I'm prioritizing reliability?

Thanks for your time and experience!

907,"Hi, I've gone off the deep end here and I would like a bigger charger. I currently have a Folomov A2 and it is very nice, but I'd like to see what people recommend for a 4+ bay charger.

**Needs**: I need to be able to charge 2 26650s at a time. I also need it to charge down to 14500s. I need it to be reliable.

**Wants**: I'd like it to have features to monitor battery health. It would be nice to see how many mA my batteries are taking in. If possible I'd like it to auto select the correct charge current for the battery.

**Budget**: I'd like to keep it around $50, but if there is a charger out there worth it I could put aside up to $100 for it.

**Price Range**:   
30, 50 max if there is a huge difference in quality.

**Purpose**:   
Running during night, **in all weathers**. 

**Battery Type &amp; Quantity**:   
No idea about this, but i would prefer it to use something rechargeable (so every type of battery is fine, I think?). Would not mind it being a built in one. The light should last **at the very least 75 minutes**.

**Size**:   
It should not be too annoying, sadly i do not have any idea where i draw my line there.  
If it sits tight weight should not be an issue but i would rather not wear a backpack. The last one had a heavy battery pack, which forced the back part to drop and in turn the front part to rise, which was annoying.  
Sorry for this vague statement i simply lack the experience to know my preference.

**Type**:   
I sadly don't even know how they are properly called. ""Body-light"" does not yield the proper products and ""running-light"" only a single one which i would rather no buy again. 

**Main Use**:   
Carrying should not apply here i think?..  
I am trying to illuminate my close surroundings, so no need for a strong light. I always used the old one on ""low"" and was fine.  
It should work between -20 and 25C° (-4 and 77F°) and in all weathers hail, rain, snow and storm.

**Switch Type**:   
I do not have any preference at all. It will be turned on and off exactly once per use.


**Anything Else?**:  
I hope i did not randomly skip these kind of lights in the arbitrary list of popular lights... and hope that this information is enough.

So about an hour ago I walked past the shelf where my Tn42 resides and noticed a dim glow coming from it. Picked it up and to my horror it was on, but in what we'd describe as 'Moonlight mode.'


I haven't used it in about 6 weeks, it was turned off when I put down last, and the batteries were charged fully. Pulled them all out and put in the Xtar vc4 and they were up to full in about 20 mins.

Replaced into light, turned it on to the same outcome. (A faint glow) Tested them individually in my other 18650 lights and they work fine. It will turn on faintly sometimes, others not. It will not turn off unless the body is unscrewed to break contact. 

As I'm typing this, it just turned itself on again to that ominous glow..... Is my driver shot? It has never been so much as dropped in the 16 odd months I've had it. Ebay purchase so I don't like my chance of a return.",Thrunite Tn42 sudden problem,flashlight,"Hey everybody,

The pictures on this one make it look like its running LED's, but I'm not worried ONLY about this specific model. Search ""HID Flashlight"" and a lot come up. 

Does anyone here have any info on these lights, and their legitimacy?

939,"1. I had a Stylus Pro in lime green for years (Which I found, important), and when I thought I lost it, I got another in black to replace it. The green one's threaded connectors all turned very smoothly, but the threads on the new one feel like they grind when screwing or unscrewing them. Was the smoothness on the older one due to something the original owner put on the threads or is  that due to differing manufacturing processes? How might I replicate the feel of the old one?

&amp;#x200B;

2. I later found the older green one, but now the switch seems to be having issues. It does not work all the time, and I cannot determine what causes it to work or not work at any given time. What's the likely issue here? Can I fix it?

941,"**Price Range**: I want to spend around $40 or $50, that would be everything included, such as battery and charger, of course a lower price is always welcome as this would be my first real flashlight.

**Purpose**: i want to have an EDC flashlight that may be useful in just about any situation

**Battery Type &amp; Quantity**: I dont know much about the battery types, but I heard 18650 is whats needed if I want USB charging which is a feature I absolutely want for sure.

**Size**:  I dont mind whatever size the flashlight is but I would prefer something I can carry with me everywhere, and even if I forget a holster I could fit it in my pockets.

**Type**: Preferably a handheld flashlight.

**Main Use**:  I will be carrying this with me everywhere, but my main reason would be to use in case the power goes out, although occasionally I do some security work so it would be used on patrols as well. I want something that is durable l, because I will also be using it for camping on a regular basis.

**Switch Type**:  I have no preference, so anything goes for this type.

**Anything Else?**:  I recently discovered this subreddit, and I find it amazing. Im trying to build an emergency backpack in which I will keep a spare flashlight but I also want one to have on me at all times, so if one could be reccomended for an emergency backup as well that would be great. The only real requirements I want are that they are USB chargeable, and waterproof. I don't mind whatever else is reccomended, and I wouldn't mind starting a nice collection so reccomend as many as you want! My favorite color is purple, so if it could be a purple color that would just be a plus, but if it isnt I honestly dont mind as long as it isnt blue, thats my least favorite color. I currently dont have a preference to the type of light as far as color, but I heard Natural White is what most people like? I just want something awesome that might also impress the average person, but that will be useful in my day to day life.",[Help Me] I want an affordable EDC flashlight that is waterproof and usb chargeable,flashlight,"**Price Range**: I want to spend around $40 or $50, that would be everything included, such as battery and charger, of course a lower price is always welcome as this would be my first real flashlight.

950,"Hello all!

I'm building a flashlight from scratch, I have done one before but only with a single LED. I used a 100W cob chip and 5s 18650 pack. I'd prefer to optimize for maximum brightness. 

My parts so far: Using 

3\* xhp70.2 cree LED's wired in series or parallel ( I assume parallel to be the brightest?).

\- 12.2 forward voltage, @2400ma max amperage. 

&amp;#x200B;

Powering it with a 5S 18650 pack I made @ \~20-21v

&amp;#x200B;

Using a 150W buck/boost converter. 8a max , 8-40 vin max , 9-46 vout max. 

&amp;#x200B;

Using cpu heatsink + spotlight reflector cone and TIR plastic lens.

&amp;#x200B;

Will have a voltage/amperage display mounted for battery pack to detect low voltage and max current amperage load. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now my wiring question! Testing each LED individually, they seem to require Vin of 15 volts set on the boost converter and consume \~2A during load. I assume this to be the max 29.6w rating. Right? So this means if i'm using 3 in parallel I will need to have the boost converter set to \~45v. Correct? Thats 3\* 15v for each LED. The amperage will be 2A across each LED, and pulling about 6A from the battery pack.

&amp;#x200B;

Does this sound correct? Lastly, the biggest part, when I used an online wiring diagram, it suggested putting a 10w 1ohm resistor after each LED. I.e in series, only 1 resistor at the end, or in parallel, 1 after each LED for a total of 3. Do I really need that 10w 1 ohm resistor in this build? Is it mandatory? 

This was the online calculator - using the numbers I listed above.

Not all are meant for EDC use.  I have a second Convoy on the way on the slow boat right now.  I will likely attempt to carry it as its just common black and cheaper.  I like the idea of 1000 lumens in my pocket but have gotten by with less for a long time.

Shipping was very fast, it came from Hong Kong to Seattle, WA in 6 days, processing took 3 days and shipping took another 3 days through DHL. Upon unboxing, the feel is nice and sturdy and the knobby exterior is sure to provide grip. The battery compartment is well oiled and feels satisfying to open. The black finish is very nice and fully covered. The custom settings are insane, lightning mode is something I’ve yet to see in another light. When on, the colors are not perfect like the Nichia 219b so the 6500 is not necessarily for tint lovers. However, if you’re looking for a very bright, compact light, this is the right one! It does heat up pretty fast so turbo does not last long but normal high ramp is a ton of light from factory. You can adjust ramp down temperature settings but I do not plan on making adjustments there.

989,"NLD  I just received my new Sofirn SP10v2.

Hello.  Waited til darkness to talk to you about my new friend.  I wanted to check this light in actual night conditions.

First impression, I like it a lot and do recommend the light for EDC.

The Moonlight .5 lumen is perfect!  I can walk around in dark and turn on Moonlight and not blind myself.  In fact I ordered this light just for the .5 lumen setting.  Works well.

The dreaded disco (or dance) mode is well buried in user interface, not likely to accidentally turn it on.  Well spaced brightness modes allowing a good balance between battery life and light.  When off or any brightness, double click, strait to turbo. Excellent!

The lockout mode needs some work.  If the light is off and the switch is continuously pushed nothing happens but a momentary push turns light on. When locked out is activated, a double flash lets you know it is locked.  A push of the switch causes the light to double flash letting you know the light is locked but continuously pushing switch causes the light to continuously flash (almost Dreaded disco mode again).  If I have the light locked, I do not want the light doing anything when the switch is pushed.  I could accept a double flash if the switch is pushed but continuously flashing defeats the purpose of lockout.

&amp;#x200B;

~~Hopefully Sofirn changes the function of lockout and releases Version 3~~.

edit: grammer

Update.  Went on 2 hikes with light.  First hike 4 miles, light in front pocket where It should have had the most twisting action. I turned head a tiny bit to prevent accidental turn on.  After hike no noticeable movement in head of light.  It was in the same position I put in my pocket.

2nd hike at night with light clipped to hat.  Loved the .5 lumen setting but a little dim where the trail was very steep and rocky.  The second setting at 15 lumen was a little bright but put in a AA battery and dropped output to 5 lumen.  Not a huge difference but kept enough of my night vision to see stars and distant light.

I liked the light first night I had it but I love it now.

I have some 2200 mah 18650 cells scavenged from an old battery pack, though I do need a charger as well, and am considering getting some decent budget cells from said chinese discounter too.


**Purpose**:  Main function will be as a bicycle light, and pocket carried. Secondary use is if and when needed in darker areas as I am a bit night blind. tertiary function might be during night time fishing. 

**Battery Type &amp; Quantity**:  I'm looking for basically a 18650 flashlight, potentially 2 cells is acceptable too. 


**Size**: Flexible in length, weight. Body shouldn't be too thick / wide in order to fit into my steering wheel clamp. 


**Type**:  Handheld flashlight, barrel flashlight, I don't know what it's specifically called, basically the typical model with the light coming out one end of the cylinder, a battery cap on the other side. 


**Main Use**:  Main use will be city street illumination from a bicycle steering wheel, from in a handlebar clamp, and some use to light dark areas in alleys on foot. So I'm hoping for something with an adjustable focus and various power levels, in order to better suit my need, adjusting it both in focus and brightness it won't annoy other road users. Carrying of the light when not on the handlebar, will happen in a pants pocket / backpack / jacket pocket, depending on what I have with me, and it should be at the very least rain proof.


**Switch Type**: Looking for a tailswitch, either by itself, or in combination with a mode side switch, or a side switch with a lockout function, due to it being carried in my pocket.  


**Anything Else?**:  So far I've found the Sofirn SP31A, or the SP32A. the 32A exists in 3 versions on the official Sofirn Ali store, regular, new, new v2.0. They seem to be mostly what I'm looking for, with decent low power modes, and either dual switch or lock funtion. (Though I'm not sure the 2.0 has one) But sadly they don't seem to be adjustable. [Sofrin store](https://sofirn.aliexpress.com)

In regards to charger / batteries, as I said before, I have some 2200 mah 16850 cells from an old battery pack, and have been looking at , the brand Liitokala, specifically their Lii-PD4 charger, and their 3000 Mah 30 amp high discharge batteries, or the 3400 Mah batteries, though I'm new to the world of 18650, and I just picked these on a whim.

I don't think I actually need one, but was just curious if anyone else had some insight.Thoughts on the Emisar GT Micro vs say an Emisar D1?"

It and my fully serrated Spyderco Paramilitary 2  are my most used tools and I am never without them.

However, as perfect as the G19 is for most jobs I do, they don't seem to last long before they start flickering. The size is perfect, because I primarily hold it in my mouth while working. The spotlight is also perfect, because I love having my light concentrated into a perfect circle for tight work.

I don't want extra functions or a twist on/off. Single function push-button only.

Thank you for any suggestions.","Looking for a light very similar to the COAST G19 Inspection Beam LED Penlight, but with a bit more power and reliability.",flashlight,"I am a Handyman and I use the [COAST G19 Inspection Beam LED Penlight](https://www.amazon.com/Inspection-Penlight-Adjustable-Consistent-Brightness/dp/B008X2QMKY/ref=pd_bxgy_469_img_2/135-5014908-9506457?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=B008X2QMKY&amp;pd_rd_r=67596dbe-3eb4-11e9-978f-fb6c120e89ee&amp;pd_rd_w=VdKtO&amp;pd_rd_wg=1JlMF&amp;pf_rd_p=6725dbd6-9917-451d-beba-16af7874e407&amp;pf_rd_r=TPFNXTW8RERCKNX9B0G1&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=TPFNXTW8RERCKNX9B0G1) constantly.
