Thinking about posting original content in r/Poetry? Here's how: 

- Step 1: ***DON'T.*** 
- Step 2: ***SERIOUSLY. DON'T.***
- Step 3: ***SEE STEPS 1 &amp; 2.***

#Tags

r/Poetry does not accept original content submissions, under any circumstances. Do not use the [POEM] tag to post original poetry. Do not use the [OPINION] tag to post original poetry. Do not use the [PROMO] tag to post original poetry. Do not use the [ARTICLE] tag to post original poetry. Do not post original poetry in this subreddit. 

*****

#Why 

Several years ago, r/Poetry splintered off and created our sister subreddit, r/OCPoetry specifically for this purpose. All original content should be posted there, ***after reading and following the rules there***.  

*****

#Consequences  

Mods are grumpy, and unwilling to continue putting in hours upon hours of unpaid work every day removing dozens of posts that all break Rule 1. Mods can and will enforce bans for breaking the Rules. The Rules are plastered literally everywhere we are able to put them: in the sidebar, in the report menus, in the wiki, and even, now in this stickied post at the top of the page. There are *NO EXCUSES* for not reading them. We have done literally everything we can to help you find them. Consider this the friendliest of friendly grumpy warnings.  

*****

#Exceptions 

There is ***ONE*** exception to this rule. If all of the below are true...

- (1) You are promoting your own ***PROFESSIONALLY PUBLISHED*** poetry book or magazine (not self-published) 
- (2) You are using the [PROMO] Tag
- (3) You want to show an example of the type of poetry your audience might expect to purchase in that book or magazine  

Then, it's good etiquette to provide an example, maybe even two, of the type of content you are promoting, somewheres in your post, so that people can see whether or not it's content they want to purchase, and make an informed consumer decision. Other things you will want to include, so that you don't have your post removed under a Rule 1 break: 

- (1) At least one link to a place that readers can buy your book, either online or in brick and mortar stores
- (2) The purchase price of your book or magazine 
- (3) The name of your publisher

1,"After every war
someone has to clean up.
Things won’t
straighten themselves up, after all.

Someone has to push the rubble
to the side of the road,
so the corpse-filled wagons
can pass.

Someone has to get mired
in scum and ashes,
sofa springs,
splintered glass,
and bloody rags.

Someone has to drag in a girder
to prop up a wall.
Someone has to glaze a window,
rehang a door.

Photogenic it’s not,
and takes years.
All the cameras have left
for another war.

We’ll need the bridges back,
and new railway stations.
Sleeves will go ragged
from rolling them up.

Someone, broom in hand,
still recalls the way it was.
Someone else listens
and nods with unsevered head.
But already there are those nearby
starting to mill about
who will find it dull.

From out of the bushes
sometimes someone still unearths
rusted-out arguments
and carries them to the garbage pile.

Those who knew
what was going on here
must make way for
those who know little.
And less than little.
And finally as little as nothing.

In the grass that has overgrown
causes and effects,
someone must be stretched out
blade of grass in his mouth
gazing at the clouds.",[POEM] The End and The Beginning by Wislawa Szymborska,Poetry,"After every war

I told my wrath, my wrath did end. 

I was angry with my foe: 

I told it not, my wrath did grow. 



And I watered it in fears, 

Night &amp; morning with my tears: 

And I sunned it with smiles, 

And with soft deceitful wiles. 



And it grew both day and night. 

Till it bore an apple bright. 

And my foe beheld it shine, 

And he knew that it was mine. 


And into my garden stole, 

When the night had veild the pole; 

In the morning glad I see; 

My foe outstretched beneath the tree.

I’d like some paper people.

They’d be purple paper people. Maybe pop-up purple paper people.

Proper pop-up purple paper people.

“How do you prop up pop-up purple paper people?”

I hear you cry. Well I …

I’d probably prop up proper pop-up purple paper people

With a proper pop-up purple people paperclip,

But I’d pre-prepare appropriate adhesives as alternatives,

A cheeky pack of Blu Tack just in case the paper slipped.

Because I could build a pop-up metropolis.

But I wouldn’t wanna deal with all the paper people politics.

Paper politicians with their paper-thin policies,

Broken promises without appropriate apologies.

There’d be a little paper me. And a little paper you.

And we could watch paper TV and it would all be pay-per-view.

We’d see the poppy paper rappers rap about their paper package

Or watch paper people carriers get stuck in paper traffic on the A4. Paper.

There’d be a paper princess Kate but we’d all stare at paper Pippa,

And then we’d all live in fear of killer Jack the Paper-Ripper,

Because the paper propaganda propagates the people’s prejudices,

Papers printing pictures of the photogenic terrorists.

A little paper me. And a little paper you.

And in a pop-up population people’s problems pop up too.

There’d be a pompous paper parliament who remained out of touch,

And who ignored the people’s protests about all the paper cuts,

Then the peaceful paper protests would get blown to paper pieces,

By the confetti cannons manned by pre-emptive police.

And yes there’d still be paper money, so there’d still be paper greed,

And the paper piggy bankers pocketing more than they need,

Purchasing the potpourri to pepper their paper properties,

Others live in poverty and ain’t acknowledged properly.

A proper poor economy where so many are proper poor,

But while their needs are ignored the money goes to big wars.

Origami armies unfold plans for paper planes

And we remain imprisoned in our own paper chains,

But the greater shame is that it always seems to stay the same,

What changes is who’s in power choosing how to lay the blame,

They’re naming names, forgetting these are names of people,

Because in the end it all comes down to people.

I like people.

’Cause even when the situation’s dire,

It is only ever people who are able to inspire,

And on paper, it’s hard to see how we all cope.

But in the bottom of Pandora’s box there’s still hope,

And I still hope ’cause I believe in people.

People like my grandparents.

Who every single day since I was born, have taken time out of their morning to pray for me.

That’s 7892 days straight of someone checking I’m okay, and that’s amazing.

People like my aunt who puts on plays with prisoners.

People who are capable of genuine forgiveness.

People like the persecuted Palestinians.

People who go out of their way to make your life better, and expect nothing in return.

You see, people have potential to be powerful.

Just because the people in power tend to pretend to be victims

We don’t need to succumb to that system.

And a paper population is no different.

Men don’t follow titles, they follow courage, life doesn’t get easier, you get stronger. To face the darkness your heart must be pure, because genius only means hard-working all one’s life.

Play your role, do what has to be done, it’s not who you are underneath, it’s what you do that defines you. Do not for one repulse, give up the purpose that you resolved to effect.

&amp;#x200B;

Keep your hope alive and never lose your faith, the difference in winning and losing is most often, not quitting. Because if you are doing your best, you will not have to worry about failure.

&amp;#x200B;

In life, we all have an unspeakable secret, an irreversible regret, an unspeakable dream, and an unforgettable love. If you are not brave enough, nobody will back you up. Because an idea is the most precious yearning in life.

Beauty is all around you if you just open your heart to see. Dreams are one of those things that keep you going and happy.

15,"# a love poem for white boys who don’t know who i am by Thom Bean

(abridged)

    hey baby
    is this what integration is all about
    these white smiles
    these sweet caresses
    you’re not giving out in public
    are not for me
    
    i am a black gay male
    i live my life alone
    invisible to most of you
    a non-entity ignored
    shunned
    even after sex
    especially after sex
    
    i am the trick you turn to
    and never really love
    i am desired at night
    and never treated the same
    in daylight
    
    after all
    what would people think
    your friends might not understand
    your peccadillo
    your aberration
    
    still a stranger in my own community
    not a member of your tribe
    i am a nomad
    patronized and rejected
    at every turn
    
    an endangered species
    my beauty and spirit denied
    i am the ""no blacks"" referred to
    in the classifieds
    
    but i don’t need you 
    to define me
    to explain away my mystery
    i already know who i am
    if you really want to know me
    bring all your stuff with you
    not just lust or need
    
    you think i am too militant
    when i get this way
    you want to critique
    theorize
    do a paper or a thesis
    on how i should speak
    feel
    act
    think
    dress
    because i won’t allow you
    to disrespect me anymore
    because finally
    i am taking back my power
    
    to accept me 
    is a political statement
    about who we really are
    to deny me is to deny yourself
    
    if you can ascend 
    to the top of the whitest strata
    and rationalize me out of existence
    remember what i told you
    you will always be
    just another f*ggot like me
    by the same reasoning process
    that reduces me to being
    just another n*gger
    
    once you and i get over that phobia
    break with tradition
    become free to set new values
    establish our own social icons
    you will see
    that color is just another
    inconsequential barrier
    to cross
    
    i could be your lover
    unless you are too white for me
    i could be your friend
    unless i am too black for you
    we could be allies
    unless we are too afraid
    to find ourselves
    in each other

You must build a sentence like a mountain. You must start someplace flat. Someplace where you can stand and see the land roll out for miles. You must let the wind die down. The rain clear. Then you may bring them, one block at a time. You must pile them upon one another and lean each new one closer to the center so that it will hold as it rises toward the sky. Each piece must be inevitable. Like a scripture you cannot erase. You must use the colors of the earth. Colors with a sense of gravity. Colors that over time dig roots of their own and feed off the rest. You must leave places for animals. Caves and gullies. Tall stands of pines. Streams that begin as snow and melt and gather and gush and fall quiet on the flats where trout live their secret lives. If there must be people in this landscape, let their lives be the troubled lives of good people who would like to follow these mountain paths back up to the top but cannot find the way.

33,"“ There are thousands of words for every word.

I struggle with the choices, so many phrases change color in different lights, so many words are owned by tyrants and hatred, so many too are claimed for god, whichever, you choose. A single meaning would be robbery, so take a dictionary to my writings, find layered sentences on towering pages, find me there, reading you from the pages, striking a lamp to the darkness and holding out my hand.

Time is an endless map in space, occuring simultaneously and infinitely. I’m right here, and right now you’re here with me. This is a place in time, it warms my heart to share it with you.

If you stand in the darkness of your time, in the broken places where souls hurt, you’ll see the part of you that glows, that’s the part of you that has been and always will be, eternally after your final breath and since the first spark of anything; that’s You. You chose your place in time, this life, the eyes reading these words, the tongue you speak with, even amongst all the turbulence and unsung tragedies of your era. Why?

The answer to every impossible question is behind your eyes, beneath your touch, flavorless, unscented, and perfectly silent; in the chaotic nothingness of everything, where You have always remained.

You can visit this place in time, over the years, I’ll always be glad you came, it’s nice here, even nicer when you arrive. Find You and light up the darkness. I’ll always be around, in the flicker of candles resisting the wind, and in the perfect silence; with You.

“For a lifetime of servitude we purchase constricted perceptions of partitioned knowledge. While our eyes are filled endlessly, flooded with ignored relevance, we seek instead registered acceptance; decades of groveling to stone heels, trumpeting gratitude and awe at the supremacy of our ranking master. The current raging around you, rends you to your course as you endeavor the labor of breaths; treading in deeper demands, carrying your master in both of your hands. The earthy bed is but inches below your drowning feet, and hearty enough plenty to support the charge of a decided stand.

Knowledge is not a possession, and no authority may revoke it succeedingly; the exponentially accelerating lucidity of outstretching comprehension can only be surrendered willfully. Toe at those foundations, settle your feet, it’s time to stand. “

",[POEM] Unsung by Jon Stronstad,Poetry,"“ There are thousands of words for every word.

I struggle with the choices, so many phrases change color in different lights, so many words are owned by tyrants and hatred, so many too are claimed for god, whichever, you choose. A single meaning would be robbery, so take a dictionary to my writings, find layered sentences on towering pages, find me there, reading you from the pages, striking a lamp to the darkness and holding out my hand.

Time is an endless map in space, occuring simultaneously and infinitely. I’m right here, and right now you’re here with me. This is a place in time, it warms my heart to share it with you.

If you stand in the darkness of your time, in the broken places where souls hurt, you’ll see the part of you that glows, that’s the part of you that has been and always will be, eternally after your final breath and since the first spark of anything; that’s You. You chose your place in time, this life, the eyes reading these words, the tongue you speak with, even amongst all the turbulence and unsung tragedies of your era. Why?

The answer to every impossible question is behind your eyes, beneath your touch, flavorless, unscented, and perfectly silent; in the chaotic nothingness of everything, where You have always remained.

You can visit this place in time, over the years, I’ll always be glad you came, it’s nice here, even nicer when you arrive. Find You and light up the darkness. I’ll always be around, in the flicker of candles resisting the wind, and in the perfect silence; with You. As others join us here, coming and going in their times, welcome them warmly and share what you have; we all shine brightest together.”

[POEM] Unsung by Jon Stronstad"
34,"Hi everyone,

So, as the title says, I've just picked up poetry as a hobby. I've dabbled in it before, but now I'm taking it seriously. As my first step of learning, I decided to ask the people who know what they are doing (you) for some guidance. I'll be splitting this post into two sections. The first part has some general questions about how to start, and the second part will be me trying to ""get my bearings"" so to speak. So, here we go!

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 1 - general questions:**

\-First, let me tell you what I have planed on how to start as a poet. Right now my plan is to write a poem every week and then post it to r/OCPoetry to get feedback. I'll also be reading poems, as well as doing research. In fact, [here is my plan for this week.](https://i.imgur.com/iRQisl7.png) Is this a good plan? Or should I do something something different?

\-I was thinking about subscribing to some poetry channels on YouTube. Is that a good idea? And if so, which ones do you recommend? (Or perhaps there is a blog or something I should follow?)

\-Are there any resources you recommend I check out as a new poet?

\-I presume that much of improving as a poet has to do with discovering and developing your style. Are there any tests/quizzes or maybe some resources that could help me along in discovering my style?

\-How should I learn from feedback?

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 2 - ""get my bearings:""**

As a programmer, art-sy stuff like poetry has always been a bit of a mystery to me. However, I have thought about the ""philosophy"" (for lack of a better word) of it. What I'm going to do here is write a condensed version of my thoughts on poetry to see if I'm thinking the right way. The summation of my thoughts is as follows: ""Poetry seems to be, in the broadest sense, expressing yourself with words. Given that, and the fact that everyone expresses themselves in a unique way, the most important part of poetry is learning you style (i.e. learning how you express yourself). The techniques you learn are a way to improve and refine your style. So really learning to be a good poet is a journey of learning your style and improving &amp; refining it."" Am I thinking in the right way? Or am I mistaken?

&amp;#x200B;

To close I want to mention two things that might be good to know about me when you make any recommendations. 1) As I said in part 2, I'm a programmer. So my approach to things tends to be straightforward and logical. And 2) I'm going to be writing free verse poems. I can't do rhyme &amp; rhythm, I just can't. Plus, I like the style of free verse anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

Having said **all** of that, what is your advice and/or tips for me? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading and I hope what I said made sense!

*For D.*

    She swore she’d change me,
    and she did. Unzipped 
    the old skin and hid it,
    somewhere, ripped out 
    the webbing between my fingers,
    snipped off a few inches
    of my too-long and sticky tongue.
    And she had the swamp
    behind the house drained,
    convinced her dad that
    I was just like him, her mom
    that I wouldn’t returned

    that she would make it work,
    that she could make it work.

    itchy and dry, wrinkled
    when wet, and always hot.
    And there is this new face
    I wear like my own.
    And the ring on my finger,
    the gold hoop I couldn’t jump through.
    
    So now I see us everywhere,
    trapped in these bodies
    and these lives, our frantic
    gray-green eyes like fires
    banked into coals, nostalgic
    for other places, other desires.

Rose-red the brambles that the passing wind knows,
Comes a robin's note like the note of a 'cello,
And across the valley, the calling of the crows,-
'April again!'
April again! and the marsh birds swinging
Over the rushes that belong to yester-year;
Silver shines the river, and young lips are singing
Songs as old as Eden-as old and as dear;
'April again!'
April again! with a wet wind blowing,
And along the western sky a pathway of gold;
Sounds a call to follow the road we're not knowing,
A new road-a wild road-o'er fairy lands unrolled,-
'April again!'
April again! with its wonder of gladness,
April with its haunting joy, and swift-stinging tears,-
Month of mist and music, and the old moon-madness,
Month of magic fluting, the spirit only hears,-
'April again!'

I offered him my arm like a branch.

He tipped his trunk towards me

like a shoulder.

I tipped my shoulder to him

like a knotted trunk.

I could hear his sap quicken, beating

like blood.

He could hear my blood slacken like rising sap.

I passed through him.

He passed through me.

I remained a solitary tree.

He 

a solitary man.



*In memory of the Romanian poet Nichita Stanescu which today he would’ve been at the age of 86.*


El a întins spre mine o frunză ca o mână cu degete.

Eu am întins spre el o mână ca o frunză cu dinţi.

El a întins spre mine o ramură ca un braţ.

Eu am întins spre el braţul ca o ramură.

El şi-a înclinat spre mine trunchiul

ca un măr.

Eu am inclinat spre el umărul

ca un trunchi noduros.

Auzeam cum se-nţeteşte seva lui bătând

ca sângele.

Auzea cum se încetineşte sângele meu suind ca 

seva.

Eu am trecut prin el.

Eu am rămas un pom singur.

54,"As I walked out one evening,  
Walking down Bristol Street,  
The crowds upon the pavement  
Were fields of harvest wheat.  

And down by the brimming river  
I heard a lover sing  
Under an arch of the railway:  
‘Love has no ending.  

‘I’ll love you, dear, I’ll love you  
Till China and Africa meet,  
And the river jumps over the mountain  
And the salmon sing in the street,  

‘I’ll love you till the ocean  
Is folded and hung up to dry  
And the seven stars go squawking  
Like geese about the sky.  

‘The years shall run like rabbits,  
For in my arms I hold  
The Flower of the Ages,  
And the first love of the world.’  

But all the clocks in the city  
Began to whirr and chime:  
‘O let not Time deceive you,  
You cannot conquer Time.  

‘In the burrows of the Nightmare  
Where Justice naked is,  
Time watches from the shadow  
And coughs when you would kiss.  

‘In headaches and in worry  
Vaguely life leaks away,  
And Time will have his fancy  
To-morrow or to-day.  

‘Into many a green valley  
Drifts the appalling snow;  
Time breaks the threaded dances  
And the diver’s brilliant bow.  

‘O plunge your hands in water,  
Plunge them in up to the wrist;  
Stare, stare in the basin  
And wonder what you’ve missed.  

‘The glacier knocks in the cupboard,  
The desert sighs in the bed,  
And the crack in the tea-cup opens  
A lane to the land of the dead.  

‘Where the beggars raffle the banknotes   
And the Giant is enchanting to Jack,  
And the Lily-white Boy is a Roarer,  
And Jill goes down on her back.  

‘O look, look in the mirror?  
O look in your distress:  
Life remains a blessing  
Although you cannot bless.  

‘O stand, stand at the window  
As the tears scald and start;  
You shall love your crooked neighbour  
With your crooked heart.’  

It was late, late in the evening,  
The lovers they were gone;  
The clocks had ceased their chiming,  
And the deep river ran on.  ",[POEM]: As I walked out one evening by W. H. Auden,Poetry,"As I walked out one evening,

# Touched by an Angel

We, unaccustomed to courage  
exiles from delight  
live coiled in shells of loneliness  
until love leaves its high holy temple  
and comes into our sight  
to liberate us into life.

Love arrives  
and in its train come ecstasies  
old memories of pleasure  
ancient histories of pain.  
Yet if we are bold,  
love strikes away the chains of fear  
from our souls.

We are weaned from our timidity  
In the flush of love's light  
we dare be brave  
And suddenly we see  
that love costs all we are  
and will ever be.  
Yet it is only love  
which sets us free.

The trouble is, I can't find its source anywhere - in any of her collections etc. I don't suppose any of you are able to confirm that this is her work, and where it might have come from?

While my hair was still cut straight across my forehead




I played about the front gate, pulling flowers.




You came by on bamboo stilts, playing horse,





You walked about my seat, playing with blue plums.





And we went on living in the village of Chōkan:





Two small people, without dislike or suspicion.



&amp;nbsp;


At fourteen I married My Lord you.




I never laughed, being bashful.




Lowering my head, I looked at the wall.




Called to, a thousand times, I never looked back.


&amp;nbsp;



At fifteen I stopped scowling,




I desired my dust to be mingled with yours





Forever and forever and forever.




Why should I climb the look out?


&amp;nbsp;


At sixteen you departed,




You went into far Ku-tō-yen, by the river of swirling eddies,




And you have been gone five months.




The monkeys make sorrowful noise overhead.


&amp;nbsp;


You dragged your feet when you went out.




By the gate now, the moss is grown, the different mosses,




Too deep to clear them away!




The leaves fall early this autumn, in wind.




The paired butterflies are already yellow with August




Over the grass in the West garden;




They hurt me. I grow older.

O quam te memorem virgo ...

Stand on the highest pavement of the stair— 
Lean on a garden urn— 
Weave, weave the sunlight in your hair— 
Clasp your flowers to you with a pained surprise— 
Fling them to the ground and turn 
With a fugitive resentment in your eyes: 
But weave, weave the sunlight in your hair. 

So I would have had him leave, 
So I would have had her stand and grieve, 
So he would have left 
As the soul leaves the body torn and bruised, 
As the mind deserts the body it has used. 
I should find 
Some way incomparably light and deft, 
Some way we both should understand, 
Simple and faithless as a smile and shake of the hand. 

She turned away, but with the autumn weather 
Compelled my imagination many days, 
Many days and many hours: 
Her hair over her arms and her arms full of flowers. 
And I wonder how they should have been together! 
I should have lost a gesture and a pose. 
Sometimes these cogitations still amaze 
The troubled midnight and the noon’s repose.

they too have their story. 


Avoid loud and aggressive persons,

they are vexations to the spirit.

you may become vain and bitter;

for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.

Exercise caution in your business affairs;

for the world is full of trickery.

But let this not blind you to what virtue there is;

and everywhere life is full of heroism. 


Be yourself.

Especially, do not feign affection.

Neither be cynical about love;

for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment

it is as perennial as the grass. 



Take kindly the counsel of the years,

gracefully surrendering the things of youth.

Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.

But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.

92,"Hello poetry buffs, I hope you can help. I'm quite new to reading poems so I know very little of the ""theory"" regarding how they work. All I really know is what I was taught at school, which was really just ""this is a haiku and this is a metaphor"". So, I hope this isn't a silly question. 

Now my question is about a poetic device that possibly is used or maybe not. Basically, I want to know if a poet might write their poem in a way that it could be read in multiple ways. Like for example, writing the poem so the first word of each line makes up a sentence of its own. 

I came to this idea while reading a Fernando Pessoa poem called Suddenly a Hand. In it I decided to read only the first words of a line then skip the following line entirely, and again just read the first words of the next. Now to me this seemed to kind of make sense and I thought it could be done on purpose. Maybe it's just wishful thinking and this is a coincidence. But, I thought with the way poets play with language, that this might be a real technique. 

I've bolded the parts that got me thinking. So, please tell me if this is a thing and if you disagree that this was intentional by Pessoa. Thanks for humouring me(and any poor grammar). 

**Suddenly a hand**, part of some occult haunting,  
Between the folds of the night and of my sleep  
**Shakes me**, and I awake, and in the deep  
Neglect of night discern no face or movement.  

**Yet an old terror I have,** immanent  
And unburied, as though from a king's siege  
**Descends**, and affirms itself my liege  
Without command, without threat, without taunting.

 ",[Help]a question about how a poet might construct their poem(Fernando Pessoa as an example),Poetry,"Hello poetry buffs, I hope you can help. I'm quite new to reading poems so I know very little of the ""theory"" regarding how they work. All I really know is what I was taught at school, which was really just ""this is a haiku and this is a metaphor"". So, I hope this isn't a silly question. 

Now my question is about a poetic device that possibly is used or maybe not. Basically, I want to know if a poet might write their poem in a way that it could be read in multiple ways. Like for example, writing the poem so the first word of each line makes up a sentence of its own. 

I came to this idea while reading a Fernando Pessoa poem called Suddenly a Hand. In it I decided to read only the first words of a line then skip the following line entirely, and again just read the first words of the next. Now to me this seemed to kind of make sense and I thought it could be done on purpose. Maybe it's just wishful thinking and this is a coincidence. But, I thought with the way poets play with language, that this might be a real technique. 

I've bolded the parts that got me thinking. So, please tell me if this is a thing and if you disagree that this was intentional by Pessoa. Thanks for humouring me(and any poor grammar). 

**Suddenly a hand**, part of some occult haunting,  
Between the folds of the night and of my sleep  
**Shakes me**, and I awake, and in the deep  
Neglect of night discern no face or movement.  

**Yet an old terror I have,** immanent  
And unburied, as though from a king's siege  
**Descends**, and affirms itself my liege  
Without command, without threat, without taunting.  

**And I can feel my life** - how on a string  
Of Unconscious abruptly tightening  
**I am**, by some nocturnal hand, controlled.  

I feel that I am no one, only a shade  
**Of a face I don't see**, being in its shade,  
And in nothing exist as the dark's cold

So this guy walks into a dragon’s lair  
      and he says  
why the long tale?  
                  HAR HAR BUDDY  
says the dragon  
                  FUCK YOU.  
 

The dragon’s a classic  
the ‘57 Chevy of existential chthonic threats  
take in those Christmas colors, those   
impervious green scales, sticky candy-red firebreath,  
comes standard with a heap of rubylust  
goldhuddled treasure.  
                  Go ahead.  
                  Kick the tires, boy.  
                  See how she rides.  
 

Sit down, kid, says the dragon. Diamonds  
roll off her back like dandruff.  
 

Oh, you’d rather be called a paladin?  
I’d rather be a unicorn.  
                  Always thought that  
was the better gig. Everyone thinks  
you’re innocent. Everyone calls you  
pure. And the girls aren’t afraid  
they come right up with their little hands out  
for you to sniff  
like you’re a puppy  
and they’re gonna take you home.  
They let you put your head right  
in their laps.  
                  But nobody on this earth  
ever got what they wanted. Now  
 

I know what you came for. You want  
my body. To hang it up on a nail  
over your fireplace. Say to some milk-and-rosewater chica  
who lays her head in your lap  
look how much it takes  
to make me feel like a man.  
                  We’re in the dark now, you and me. This is primal  
shit right here. Grendel, Smaug, St. George. You’ve been  
called up. This is the big game. You don’t have  
to make stupid puns. Flash your feathers  
like your monkey bravado  
can impress. I saw a T-Rex fight a comet  
and lose. You’ve  
got nothing I want.  
 

Here’s something I bet you don’t know:  
      every time someone writes a story about a dragon  
a real dragon dies.  
                  Something about seeing  
and being seen  
                  something about mirrors  
that old tune about how a photograph  
can take your whole soul. At the end  
of this poem  
                  I’m going to go out like electricity  
in an ice storm. I’ve made peace with it.  
                  That last blockbuster took out a whole family  
                  of Bhutan thunder dragons  
living in Latvia  
the fumes of their cleargas hoard  
hanging on their beards like blue ghosts.  
 

A dragon’s gotta get zen  
                  with ephemerality.  
 

You want to cut me up? Chickenscratch my leather  
with butcher’s chalk:  
cutlets, tenderloin, ribs for the company barbecue,  
chuck, chops, brisket, roast.  
                  I dig it, I do.  
I want to eat everything, too.  
 

When I look at the world  
      I see a table.  
All those fancy houses, people with degrees, horses and whales,  
bankers and Buddha statues  
the Pope, astronauts, panda bears and yes, paladins  
                  if you let me swallow you whole  
                  I’ll call you whatever you want.  
Look at it all: waitresses and ice caps and submarines down  
at the bottom of the heavy lightless saltdark of the sea  
                  Don’t they know they’d be safer  
                  inside me?  
 

I could be big for them  
      I could hold them all  
My belly could be a city  
      where everyone was so loved  
they wouldn’t need jobs. I could be  
the hyperreal  
post-scarcity dragonhearted singularity.  
      I could eat them  
      and feed them  
      and eat them  
      and feed them.  
 

This is why I don’t get to be a unicorn.  
Those ponies have clotted cream and Chanel No. 5 for blood  
and they don’t burn up like comets  
with love that tastes like starving to death.  
      And you, with your standup comedy knightliness,  
covering Beowulf’s greatest hits on your tin kazoo,  
you can’t begin to think through  
      what it takes to fill up a body like this.  
It takes everything pretty  
and everything true  
      and you stick yourself in a cave because  
your want is bigger than you.  
 

I just want to be  
the size of a galaxy  
so I can eat all the stars and gas giants  
without them noticing  
and getting upset.  
Is that so bad?  
                  Isn’t that  
what love looks like?  
                  Isn’t that  
what you want, too?  
 

I’ll make you a deal.  
      Come close up  
stand on my emeraldheart, my sapphireself  
the goldpile of my body  
      Close enough to smell  
everything you’ll never be.  
 

Don’t finish the poem. Not for nothing  
is it a snake  
that eats her tail  
and means eternity. What’s a few verses worth  
anyway? Everyone knows  
poetry doesn’t sell. Don’t you ever feel  
like you’re just  
a story someone is telling  
about someone like you?  
                  I get that. I get you. You and me  
we could fit  
inside each other. It’s not nihilism  
if there’s really no point to anything.  
 

I have a secret  
down in the deep of my dark.  
All those other kids who wanted me  
to call them paladins,  
warriors, saints, whose swords had names,  
whose bodies were perfect  
as moonlight  
      they’ve set up a township near my liver  
had babies with the maidens they didn’t save  
      invented electric lightbulbs  
      thought up new holidays.  
                              You can have my body  
                              just like you wanted.  
Or you can keep on fighting dragons  
writing dragons  
fighting dragons  
re-staging that same old Cretaceous deathmatch  
you mammals  
always win.  
                  But hey, hush, come on.  
Quit now.  
You’ll never fix  
that line.  
                  I have a forgiveness in me  
                  the size of eons  
                  and if a dragon’s body is big enough  
                  it just looks like the world.  
 

                              Did you know  
the earth used to have two moons?

at the bottom of the heavy lightless saltdark of the sea  
                  Don’t they know they’d be safer  
                  inside me?  
 

I could be big for them  
      I could hold them all  
My belly could be a city  
      where everyone was so loved  
they wouldn’t need jobs. I could be  
the hyperreal  
post-scarcity dragonhearted singularity.  
      I could eat them  
      and feed them  
      and eat them  
      and feed them.  
 

This is why I don’t get to be a unicorn.  
Those ponies have clotted cream and Chanel No. 5 for blood  
and they don’t burn up like comets  
with love that tastes like starving to death.  
      And you, with your standup comedy knightliness,  
covering Beowulf’s greatest hits on your tin kazoo,  
you can’t begin to think through  
      what it takes to fill up a body like this.  
It takes everything pretty  
and everything true  
      and you stick yourself in a cave because  
your want is bigger than you.  
 

I just want to be  
the size of a galaxy  
so I can eat all the stars and gas giants  
without them noticing  
and getting upset.  
Is that so bad?  
                  Isn’t that  
what love looks like?  
                  Isn’t that  
what you want, too?  
 

I’ll make you a deal.  
      Come close up  
stand on my emeraldheart, my sapphireself  
the goldpile of my body  
      Close enough to smell  
everything you’ll never be.  
 

Don’t finish the poem. Not for nothing  
is it a snake  
that eats her tail  
and means eternity. What’s a few verses worth  
anyway? Everyone knows  
poetry doesn’t sell. Don’t you ever feel  
like you’re just  
a story someone is telling  
about someone like you?  
                  I get that. I get you. You and me  
we could fit  
inside each other. It’s not nihilism  
if there’s really no point to anything.  
 

I have a secret  
down in the deep of my dark.  
All those other kids who wanted me  
to call them paladins,  
warriors, saints, whose swords had names,  
whose bodies were perfect  
as moonlight  
      they’ve set up a township near my liver  
had babies with the maidens they didn’t save  
      invented electric lightbulbs  
      thought up new holidays.  
                              You can have my body  
                              just like you wanted.  
Or you can keep on fighting dragons  
writing dragons  
fighting dragons  
re-staging that same old Cretaceous deathmatch  
you mammals  
always win.  
                  But hey, hush, come on.  
Quit now.  
You’ll never fix  
that line.  
                  I have a forgiveness in me  
                  the size of eons  
                  and if a dragon’s body is big enough  
                  it just looks like the world.  
 

                              Did you know  
the earth used to have two moons?

I just got into Amy Clampitt, who's been accused of being an ""elitist"" poet whose work is ""inaccessible. After reading the following poem a few times and listening to the sonata it's about a few times and consulting the dictionary or Wikipedia a few times, it finally came together for me, and now it's arguably one of my favorites. It took a lot of work to really suss out the particulars, but what I found in it was so rewarding.

**""Beethoven, Opus 111""**

*for Norman Carey*

*“There are epochs… when mankind, not content with the present, longing for time’s deeper layers, like the plowman, thirsts for the virgin soil of time.""*  
*Osip Mandelstam*

–Or, conversely, hungers  
for the levitations of the concert hall:  
the hands like rafts of putti  
out of a region where the dolorous stars  
are fixed in glassy cerements of Art;  
the ancien regime’s diaphanous plash  
athwart the mounting throb of hobnails—  
shod squadrons of vibration  
mining the air, its struck ores hardening  
into a plowshare, a downward wandering  
disrupting every formal symmetry:  
from the supine harp-case, the strung-foot  
tendons under the mahogany, the bulldozer  
in the bass unearths a Piranesian  
catacomb: Beethoven ventilating,  
with a sound he cannot hear, the cave-in  
of recurring rage.  
                         In the tornado country  
of mid-America, my father  
might have been his twin—a farmer  
hacking at sourdock, at the strangle-  
roots of thistles and wild morning glories,  
setting out rashly, one October,  
to rid the fencerows of poison ivy:  
livid seed-globs turreted  
in trinities of glitter, ripe  
with the malefic glee no farmer doubts  
lives deep down in things. My father  
was naïve enough—by nature  
revolutionary, though he’d have  
disowned the label—to suppose he might  
in some way, minor but radical, disrupt  
the givens of existence: set  
his neighbors’ thinking straight, undo  
the stranglehold of reasons nations  
send their boys off to war. That fall,  
after the oily fireworks had cooled down  
to trellises of hairy wicks,  
he dug them up, rootstocks and all,  
and burned them. Do-gooder!  
The well-meant holocaust became  
a mist of venom, sowing itself along  
the sculptured hollows of his overalls,  
braceleting wrists and collarbone—  
a mesh of blisters spreading to a shirt  
worn like a curse. For weeks  
he writhed inside it. Awful.  
                                           High art  
with a stiff neck: an upright Steinway  
bought in Chicago; a chromo of Hobbema  
tree-avenue, or of Millet’s imagined peasant,

irrelevant: harpstrings and fripperies of air  
congealed into an object nailed against the wall,  
its sole ironic function (if it has any)  
to demonstrate that one, though he may  
grunt and sweat at work, is not a clod.  
Beethoven might declare the air  
his domicile, the winds kin, the tornado  
a kind of second cousin; here,  
his labor merely shimmers—a deracinated  
album leaf, a bagatelle, the “Moonlight”  
rendered with a dying fall (the chords  
subside, disintegrate, regroup  
in climbing sequences *con brio*) ; there’s  
no dwelling on the sweet past here,  
there being no past to speak of  
other than the setbacks: typhoid  
in the wells, half the first settlers  
dead of it before the year was out;  
diphtheria and scarlet fever  
every winter; drought, the Depression,  
a mortgage on the mortgage. High art  
as a susurrus, the silk and perfume  
of unsullied hands. Those hands!—  
driving the impressionable wild with anguish  
for another life entirely: the Lyceum circuit,  
the doomed diving bell of Art.

I have done it again.   

One year in every ten   

I manage it——  


A sort of walking miracle, my skin     
Bright as a Nazi lampshade,     
My right foot  


A paperweight,  
My face a featureless, fine     
Jew linen.  


Peel off the napkin     
O my enemy.     
Do I terrify?——  


The nose, the eye pits, the full set of teeth?     
The sour breath  
Will vanish in a day.  


Soon, soon the flesh  
The grave cave ate will be     
At home on me  


And I a smiling woman.     
I am only thirty.  
And like the cat I have nine times to die.  


This is Number Three.     
What a trash  
To annihilate each decade.  


What a million filaments.     
The peanut-crunching crowd     
Shoves in to see  


Them unwrap me hand and foot——  
The big strip tease.     
Gentlemen, ladies  


These are my hands     
My knees.  
I may be skin and bone,  


Nevertheless, I am the same, identical woman.     
The first time it happened I was ten.     
It was an accident.  


The second time I meant  
To last it out and not come back at all.     
I rocked shut  


As a seashell.  
They had to call and call  
And pick the worms off me like sticky pearls.  


Dying  
Is an art, like everything else.     
I do it exceptionally well.  


I do it so it feels like hell.     
I do it so it feels real.  
I guess you could say I’ve a call.  


It’s easy enough to do it in a cell.  
It’s easy enough to do it and stay put.     
It’s the theatrical  


Comeback in broad day  
To the same place, the same face, the same brute     
Amused shout:  


‘A miracle!’  
That knocks me out.     
There is a charge  


For the eyeing of my scars, there is a charge     
For the hearing of my heart——  
It really goes.  


And there is a charge, a very large charge     
For a word or a touch     
Or a bit of blood  


Or a piece of my hair or my clothes.     
So, so, Herr Doktor.     
So, Herr Enemy.  


I am your opus,  
I am your valuable,     
The pure gold baby

  
That melts to a shriek.     
I turn and burn.  
Do not think I underestimate your great concern.  


Ash, ash—  
You poke and stir.  
Flesh, bone, there is nothing there——  


A cake of soap,     
A wedding ring,     
A gold filling.  


Herr God, Herr Lucifer     
Beware  
Beware.  


Out of the ash  
I rise with my red hair     
And I eat men like air.",[Poem] Lady Lazarus by Sylvia Plath,Poetry,"

Through all my blood and filled my heart with light:

I wedded her with ardor undeterred

By the strange mottlings of her body white,

By the things that crept across us in her den

And the dead who lay beside us through the night.

Colder her flesh than the serpents of the fen,

Yet on her breast I lost mine ancient woe

And found the joy forbid to living men.

I think I have an idea about what's trying to be said here but I'm not entirely sure. Part of me thinks that the hair is supposed to be a metaphor for growth and life, and when you cut it you're getting rid of all of that growth (but wouldn't that make you younger again, not old...?). This would work with ""cutting my / life with / sleep to trim / my hair"", and someone who is an ""old man"" who gets his hair shaved ""twice / a week"" would be closer to death (which is I guess what cutting the hair would make you closer to, especially because you ""grow / hair on / bald death"". Logic just disagrees with me). 

However, I have no idea what the ""quartz / lamp"" and ""old men / with third / sets of teeth"" means.

For context, I'm writing an essay. Here's the instructions:

""Imagism is defined by the following principles: the direct treatment of	‘thing’; an interest in adjectives (colour);	a minimalist interest in the use of language; an inner sense of musical phrasing.

It’s over, love. Look at me pushing fifty now,
    Hair like grave-grass growing in both ears,
The piles and boggy prostate, the crooked penis,
    The sour taste of each day’s first lie,

And that recurrent dream of years ago pulling
    A swaying bead-chain of moonlight,
Of slipping between the cool sheets of dark
    Along a body like my own, but blameless.

What good’s my cut-glass conversation now,
    Now I’m so effortlessly vulgar and sad?
You get from life what you can shake from it?
    For me, it’s g and t’s all day and CNN.

Try the blond boychick lawyer, entry level
    At eighty grand, who pouts about overtime,
Keeps Evian and a beeper in his locker at the gym,
    And hash in tinfoil under the office fern.

    Curls and perfumed war-paint on his nipples.
His answering machine always has room for one more
    Slurred, embarrassed call from you-know-who.

Some nights I’ve laughed so hard the tears
    Won’t stop. Look at me now. Why now?
I long ago gave up pretending to believe
    Anyone’s memory will give as good as it gets.

Or at least of diving after you, my long-gone,
    Through the bruised unbalanced waves?",[POEM] Late Night Ode by J.D McClatchy.,Poetry,"
It’s over, love. Look at me pushing fifty now,
    Hair like grave-grass growing in both ears,
The piles and boggy prostate, the crooked penis,
    The sour taste of each day’s first lie,

And that recurrent dream of years ago pulling
    A swaying bead-chain of moonlight,
Of slipping between the cool sheets of dark
    Along a body like my own, but blameless.

What good’s my cut-glass conversation now,
    Now I’m so effortlessly vulgar and sad?
You get from life what you can shake from it?
    For me, it’s g and t’s all day and CNN.

Try the blond boychick lawyer, entry level
    At eighty grand, who pouts about overtime,
Keeps Evian and a beeper in his locker at the gym,
    And hash in tinfoil under the office fern.

There’s your hound from heaven, with buccaneer
    Curls and perfumed war-paint on his nipples.
His answering machine always has room for one more

135,"I remember watching a spoken word poem online and I can no longer find it anywhere. It was around 6 min long, spoken by a white woman with black hair. 

In the poem, a man works hard to build/restore a rural house and farm for himself. He runs it responsibly and does everything right.
One day a rat enters his house, and he doesn't really mind. More come in, and soon they are eating his grain, pooping in his food and causing trouble. Eventually tensions rise and either they turn on him after the food ran out or he snapped and stepped on one. I can't remember what happened.

He is forced to leave and the hose he worked so hard to build is run by rats. The rats are totally inept and come wintertime, they've ruined everything. Without the man to feed them many die, and they blame the human for leaving. Many of the survivors have to leave to infest new places as there is no more food.

The man comes back later in the spring. As I remember it, the narrator looks into the camera and poses the conclusion as a question to the audience. Basically asking if the rats still deserve any sympathy, or if the man should eradicate them and not let anymore in.

Any ideas how I could find this?

I bleed through the breath I cannot hold.  
Is there anything that will never leave us?  
We drive beyond the mind's own weight  
a blue thread hanging from a shirt,  
another wisp in the universe.  
The good people I know must be covering  
their faces beneath the light in the trees.  
The animals of the Pentecost are always near.  

I love the feel of a knife or a violin  
moving through the emptiness of a room  
filled with vacant chairs and tables. 
I walk past a monument of stone  
where the sculptor waved his hammer  
and cried in the dust of himself  
some words for two miserable hands.  
Each breath I cannot hold is given to what is green  
as green makes its silence.  
There is a strap you can wear  
that keeps you from spilling yourself  
as you strain for another word,  
lifting what you must.  

I like the feel of a pencil or a guitar.  
It is my duty to stop hurting myself  
but I have always failed. 
For the God who is silence  
I am devoted to the breathing of the sea  
and to little statues likely to lose an arm or a nose.  
To the maesta, her veil blown free of the Byzantine  
and against the lips of a new century  
that kisses me bleeding before I could be born

I am creating a free weekly email newsletter that puts around 5 links to great poetry into your inbox. I hope to bring this poetry to a wider audience of people who like poetry, not just writers.

The third approached the animal, and, happening to take,
the squirming trunk within his hands, ""I see,"" quoth he,
the elephant is very like a snake!""

The fourth reached out his eager hand, and felt about the knee:
""What most this wondrous beast is like, is mighty plain,"" quoth he;
""Tis clear enough the elephant is very like a tree.""

The fifth, who chanced to touch the ear, Said; ""E'en the blindest man
can tell what this resembles most; Deny the fact who can,

The sixth no sooner had begun, about the beast to grope,
than, seizing on the swinging tail, that fell within his scope,
""I see,"" quothe he, ""the elephant is very like a rope!""

And so these men of Indostan, disputed loud and long,

168,"If you don't know the kind of person I am

and I don't know the kind of person you are

a pattern that others made may prevail in the world

and following the wrong god home we may miss our star.

&amp;#x200B;

For there is many a small betrayal in the mind,

a shrug that lets the fragile sequence break

sending with shouts the horrible errors of childhood

storming out to play through the broken dike.

&amp;#x200B;

And as elephants parade holding each elephant's tail,

but if one wanders the circus won't find the park,

I call it cruel and maybe the root of all cruelty

to know what occurs but not recognize the fact.

&amp;#x200B;

And so I appeal to a voice, to something shadowy,

a remote important region in all who talk:

though we could fool each other, we should consider—

lest the parade of our mutual life get lost in the dark.

&amp;#x200B;

For it is important that awake people be awake,

or a breaking line may discourage them back to sleep;

the signals we give — yes or no, or maybe —

should be clear: the darkness around us is deep.","[Poem] ""A Ritual to Read to Each Other"" - William Stafford",Poetry,"If you don't know the kind of person I am

and I don't know the kind of person you are

a pattern that others made may prevail in the world

and following the wrong god home we may miss our star.

&amp;#x200B;

For there is many a small betrayal in the mind,

a shrug that lets the fragile sequence break

sending with shouts the horrible errors of childhood

storming out to play through the broken dike.

&amp;#x200B;

And as elephants parade holding each elephant's tail,

but if one wanders the circus won't find the park,

I call it cruel and maybe the root of all cruelty

to know what occurs but not recognize the fact.

&amp;#x200B;

And so I appeal to a voice, to something shadowy,

a remote important region in all who talk:

though we could fool each other, we should consider—

lest the parade of our mutual life get lost in the dark.

&amp;#x200B;

For it is important that awake people be awake,

or a breaking line may discourage them back to sleep;

the signals we give — yes or no, or maybe —

should be clear: the darkness around us is deep.[Poem] ""A Ritual to Read to Each Other"" - William Stafford"

BY [MAYA ANGELOU](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/maya-angelou)

You may write me down in history  
With your bitter, twisted lies,  
You may trod me in the very dirt  
But still, like dust, I'll rise.  
Does my sassiness upset you?  
Why are you beset with gloom?  
’Cause I walk like I've got oil wells  
Pumping in my living room.  
Just like moons and like suns,  
With the certainty of tides,  
Just like hopes springing high,  
Still I'll rise.  
Did you want to see me broken?  
Bowed head and lowered eyes?  
Shoulders falling down like teardrops,  
Weakened by my soulful cries?  
Does my haughtiness offend you?  
Don't you take it awful hard  
’Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines  
Diggin’ in my own backyard.  
You may shoot me with your words,  
You may cut me with your eyes,  
You may kill me with your hatefulness,  
But still, like air, I’ll rise.  
Does my sexiness upset you?  
Does it come as a surprise  
That I dance like I've got diamonds  
At the meeting of my thighs?  
Out of the huts of history’s shame  
I rise  
Up from a past that’s rooted in pain  
I rise  
I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,  
Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.  
Leaving behind nights of terror and fear  
I rise  
Into a daybreak that’s wondrously clear  
I rise  
Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,  
I am the dream and the hope of the slave.  
I rise  
I rise  
I rise.

Looking forward to poems from your countries that were not previously translated and you think are too good not to share with people from other countries.

&amp;#x200B;

I know you’ll cheat on me tomorrow…

But since today you give your whole to me,

You are forgiven -

The sin is old

And you are not the first to wrong!…

&amp;#x200B;

To honor you,

The prettiest of liars,

In silver censers, poisonous incense I’ve burned

Your bed I’ve sprinkled full of poppies

And clove pinks -

All bloody flowers -

I’ve stained your pillow’s lace with smell of pine,

And in the carpet on the wall like in a vase I stung

Three leafy branches of thyme

And one of crusty Eucalitpus.

&amp;#x200B;

But see,

Midnight is here…

The time when lovers, in older eras,

Together devoured the blessed poison…

So come,

Come and untie your hair from your ivory chest,

Stick The Lie in your eyes

And The Truth in your lips’ warmth.

&amp;#x200B;

From all the lucky ones who had you

How many dead

And others cursing that they can’t forget you?…

&amp;#x200B;

I know you’ll cheat on me tomorrow…

But since today you give your whole to me,

You are forgiven -

The sin is old

And you are not the first to wrong!…

&amp;#x200B;

So I don’t ask for words paired up with kisses,

I do not ask of you to say

Things you have told the others,

But, what a soul you haven’t told.

&amp;#x200B;

And I don’t ask for endless crazy ardor,

I do not ask

A thing of what the pale poet

Begs, always alone,

I want but you to change a moment

From all the moments that are like,

To pour a hydromel’s glass infinity into my soul,

My hair to braid with fresh laurel wreath

And in my looks

To petrify for good the lie of all pure loves

&amp;#x200B;

So, quiet -

As shadows, flung upon a flower pile -

To start the rite at midnight

And finish on the morrow’s dawn!

*Dans le fond des forêts votre image me suit.*

RACINE

There is a panther stalks me down:

One day I’ll have my death of him;

His greed has set the woods aflame,

He prowls more lordly than the sun.

Most soft, most suavely glides that step,

Advancing always at my back;

From gaunt hemlock, rooks croak havoc:

The hunt is on, and sprung the trap.

Flayed by thorns I trek the rocks,

Haggard through the hot white noon.

Along red network of his veins

What fires run, what craving wakes?

Insatiate, he ransacks the land

Condemned by our ancestral fault,

Crying: blood, let blood be spilt;

Meat must glut his mouth’s raw wound.

Keen the rending teeth and sweet

The singeing fury of his fur;

His kisses parch, each paw’s a briar,

Doom consummates that appetite.

In the wake of this fierce cat,

Kindled like torches for his joy,

Charred and ravened women lie,

Become his starving body’s bait.

Now hills hatch menace, spawning shade;

Midnight cloaks the sultry grove;

The black marauder, hauled by love

On fluent haunches, keeps my speed.

Behind snarled thickets of my eyes

Lurks the lithe one; in dreams’ ambush

Bright those claws that mar the flesh

And hungry, hungry, those taut thighs.

His ardor snares me, lights the trees,

And I run flaring in my skin;

What lull, what cool can lap me in

When burns and brands that yellow gaze?

I hurl my heart to halt his pace,

To quench his thirst I squander blood;

He eats, and still his need seeks food,

Compels a total sacrifice.

His voice waylays me, spells a trance,

The gutted forest falls to ash;

Appalled by secret want, I rush

From such assault of radiance.

Entering the tower of my fears,

I shut my doors on that dark guilt,

I bolt the door, each door I bolt.

Blood quickens, gonging in my ears:

The panther’s tread is on the stairs,

Coming up and up the stairs.

193,"   The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold,
And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold;
And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea,
When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee.

   Like the leaves of the forest when Summer is green,
That host with their banners at sunset were seen:
Like the leaves of the forest when Autumn hath blown,
That host on the morrow lay withered and strown.

   For the Angel of Death spread his wings on the blast,
And breathed in the face of the foe as he passed;
And the eyes of the sleepers waxed deadly and chill,
And their hearts but once heaved, and for ever grew still!

   And there lay the steed with his nostril all wide,
But through it there rolled not the breath of his pride;
And the foam of his gasping lay white on the turf,
And cold as the spray of the rock-beating surf.

   And there lay the rider distorted and pale,
With the dew on his brow, and the rust on his mail:
And the tents were all silent, the banners alone,
The lances unlifted, the trumpet unblown.

And yonder soft phial, the exquisite blue,

To carry pure death in an earring, a casket,
A signet, a fan-mount, a filigree basket!

And try it and taste, ere she fix and prefer!

It kills her, and this prevents seeing it close:
The delicate droplet, my whole fortune’s fee—
If it hurts her, beside, can it ever hurt me?

That brought the sunshine to one face—

No act most small

That helped some soul and nothing cost—

Then count that day as worse than lost.

Like a calendar in one color.

I wear a torn place on my sleeve.

Just from thinking it over.
Oh I know

I’ve no excuse to be stuck here turning

Like a mirror on a string,

Except it’s hardly credible how

It all keeps changing.

As if I had a system

I shuffle among the lies

Turning them over, if only

Poke them till the eyes open.

They don’t recall what it looked like.

When was I using it last?

Was it like a ring or a light

Or the autumn pond

Which chokes and glitters but

Grows colder?

It could be all in the mind.  Anyway

Nothing seems to bring it back to me.


And I’ve been to see

Your hands as trees borne away on a flood,

The same film over and over,

And an old one at that, shattering its account

To the last of the digits, and nothing

And the blank end.


The lightning has shown me the scars of the future.


I’ve had a long look at someone

Alone like a key in a lock

Without what it takes to turn.



It isn’t as simple as that.


Winter will think back to your lit harvest

For which there is no help, and the seed

Of eloquence will open its wings

When you are gone.

When the nails are kissing the fingers good-bye

inches from mine, smooth-shaven, loving, alert.

of you? Without a photograph, without strain?  

So when I saw your unguarded, reliable face,   
your unmistakable gaze opening all the warmth

each other for the time the dream allowed.

Roald Dahl Poem.

&gt;Little Red Riding Hood And The Wolf - Poem by Roald Dahl

&gt;As soon as Wolf began to feel  
That he would like a decent meal,  
He went and knocked on Grandma's door.  
When Grandma opened it, she saw  
The sharp white teeth, the horrid grin,  
And Wolfie said, 'May I come in?'  
Poor Grandmamma was terrified,  
'He's going to eat me up!' she cried.  
And she was absolutely right.  
He ate her up in one big bite.  
But Grandmamma was small and tough,  
And Wolfie wailed, 'That's not enough!  
I haven't yet begun to feel  
That I have had a decent meal!'  
He ran around the kitchen yelping,  
'I've got to have a second helping!'    


&gt;Then added with a frightful leer,  
'I'm therefore going to wait right here  
Till Little Miss Red Riding Hood  
Comes home from walking in the wood.'    


&gt;He quickly put on Grandma's clothes,  
(Of course he hadn't eaten those).  
He dressed himself in coat and hat.  
He put on shoes, and after that,  
He even brushed and curled his hair,  
Then sat himself in Grandma's chair.    


&gt;In came the little girl in red.  
She stopped. She stared. And then she said,  
'What great big ears you have, Grandma.'  
'All the better to hear you with,'  
the Wolf replied.  
'What great big eyes you have, Grandma.'  
said Little Red Riding Hood.  
'All the better to see you with,'  
the Wolf replied.  
He sat there watching her and smiled.  
He thought, I'm going to eat this child.  
Compared with her old Grandmamma,  
She's going to taste like caviar.  


&gt;Then Little Red Riding Hood said, '  
But Grandma, what a lovely great big  
furry coat you have on.'  


&gt;'That's wrong!' cried Wolf.  
'Have you forgot  
To tell me what BIG TEETH I've got?  
Ah well, no matter what you say,  
I'm going to eat you anyway.'    


&gt;The small girl smiles. One eyelid flickers.  
She whips a pistol from her knickers.  
She aims it at the creature's head,  
And bang bang bang, she shoots him dead.    


&gt;A few weeks later, in the wood,  
I came across Miss Riding Hood.  
But what a change! No cloak of red,  
No silly hood upon her head.  
She said, 'Hello, and do please note  
My lovely furry wolfskin coat.'

📷**Gopakumar Menon**

**THE VILLAGE SCHOOL MASTER** Oliver Goldsmith 

**Outline**📷The village school master who ran his little school was a severe disciplinarian. The students were afraid of him and were sufficiently clever to assess from his face whether that day would bring any misfortune or not. In spite of his strictness, the school master was jolly. The children laughed at his jokes with pretended joy. If they noticed any sign of anger on his face they would spread the news throughout the classroom.The school master was, in reality, a kind-hearted person. His only fault was his excessive love for learning. He could write, work out sums, survey land, forecast the time and tide and measure the content of a vessel. He was a master at argument, too. He used verbose words when he talked and the simple village people would gawk at him. They were amazed that such a small head could hold such an enormous hoard of knowledge.

**Summary of the Poem** The village school master ran his little school in a small village. It was situated next to the irregular fence that fringed the village path with full blossomed, beautiful but ornamental furze. He was not only a very strict disciplinarian but also a ferocious person to observe. He was familiar to the poet and all other truants because they had endured the master’s rage. His face was a thing of careful scrutiny. The trembling pupils would gaze at his face to sense his present frame of mind. The day misfortunes were written on his forehead or in between the eyebrows.The school master was a contradiction. Although he was stern, he was kind and good-humoured. He had a store of jokes. When he told them, the children burst out in fake laughter, under the pretext that the jokes were awfully hilarious. If the children observed a frown on his fore head, they circulated the gloomy news throughout the classroom in an undertone. But he was in essence a kind man. If at all he had any fault, it was his intense love for learning. He wanted his pupils to become genuine scholar and hence, he had to be demanding with them.The villagers were unanimous in their opinion that he really was an erudite man. He without doubt could write and also work out sums in arithmetic. He could also survey land, forecast weather and tides. Besides, he was able to measure the content of a vessel .The parson approved of his skill in debate. Even if defeated, the school master would keep on arguing. He would become more fervent and would fling booming words at his adversary. The uncomprehending villagers would be convinced that the school master was establishing his standpoint very thoroughly. They stood round the two debaters and witnessed the verbal duel. They were awestruck when they heard the high-sounding and incomprehensible words used by the school master. They gawked at him and wondered how his small head could keep that enormous hoard of knowledge.

**Appreciation** This poem is a simple vignette of a village school master. The school was in a small village at Lissoy, an Irish village where the poet himself had studied. Mr. Thomas Paddy Byrne was the village school master. This poem has become one of the classics of literature because of the ring of genuineness. As the poet himself was a pupil of this school master, he is able to create an authentic aura to the poem. With a fleeting allusion to the site, the poet starts to describe the man. The school master’s fluctuating moods, the situation in the class room and reactions of learner are described in this poem. It is amply obvious that Goldsmith looked upon the teacher with the mixed feelings of fear, respect and humour.The poet gives an amusing sketch of the teacher’s character with a deep sympathy for him. He analyses of the nature and capability of the school master. The teacher was a taskmaster who took his students to task if they played truant. The poet, as a student, was very aware of this facet of the school master but he valued his stand and came to love and respect him. The harsh steps taken by the teacher had a soft and virtuous purpose behind them as he wished to see his pupils turn in to learned people.The school master’s is recognised as a great scholarly person by the entire village and even the parson recognises his skill in debate. The oratory of the teacher leaves the rustics gazing in admiration. The poem ends on a note of humour. The teacher is not to be taken as a sheer sardonic sketch. Besides, his academic affectations, he was remarkably kind and compassionate . The scowl on his face often masks a heart brimming with love and consideration. He has smattering of useful information which he puts to good use with the illiterate and ignorant villagers. Thus he creates a larger than life figure of himself before them. He has a view on every subject and loves to engage in debate above all with the village priest. He knows that in the eyes of the villagers the conclusion of the debate depends more on noise than on wisdom. Hence he keeps arguing even if he is defeated.Goldsmith’s portrait of his former school master is a tour de force of depiction. He manages to make fun of the schoolmaster’s idiosyncrasies while maintaining reverence and admiration for him. The forte of the poem lies in the way in which Goldsmith has neither idealised nor trivialised the school master. On the other hand, the school master brush stroked to make him more humane.",[Article] Poetry Study Aid : The Village School Master Oliver Goldsmith,Poetry,"# Poetry Study Aid : The Village School Master

He wanted his pupils to become genuine scholar and hence, he had to be demanding with them.The villagers were unanimous in their opinion that he really was an erudite man. He without doubt could write and also work out sums in arithmetic. He could also survey land, forecast weather and tides. Besides, he was able to measure the content of a vessel .The parson approved of his skill in debate. Even if defeated, the school master would keep on arguing. He would become more fervent and would fling booming words at his adversary. The uncomprehending villagers would be convinced that the school master was establishing his standpoint very thoroughly. They stood round the two debaters and witnessed the verbal duel. They were awestruck when they heard the high-sounding and incomprehensible words used by the school master. They gawked at him and wondered how his small head could keep that enormous hoard of knowledge.

**Appreciation** This poem is a simple vignette of a village school master. The school was in a small village at Lissoy, an Irish village where the poet himself had studied. Mr. Thomas Paddy Byrne was the village school master. This poem has become one of the classics of literature because of the ring of genuineness. As the poet himself was a pupil of this school master, he is able to create an authentic aura to the poem. With a fleeting allusion to the site, the poet starts to describe the man. The school master’s fluctuating moods, the situation in the class room and reactions of learner are described in this poem. It is amply obvious that Goldsmith looked upon the teacher with the mixed feelings of fear, respect and humour.The poet gives an amusing sketch of the teacher’s character with a deep sympathy for him. He analyses of the nature and capability of the school master. The teacher was a taskmaster who took his students to task if they played truant. The poet, as a student, was very aware of this facet of the school master but he valued his stand and came to love and respect him. The harsh steps taken by the teacher had a soft and virtuous purpose behind them as he wished to see his pupils turn in to learned people.The school master’s is recognised as a great scholarly person by the entire village and even the parson recognises his skill in debate. The oratory of the teacher leaves the rustics gazing in admiration. The poem ends on a note of humour. The teacher is not to be taken as a sheer sardonic sketch. Besides, his academic affectations, he was remarkably kind and compassionate . The scowl on his face often masks a heart brimming with love and consideration. He has smattering of useful information which he puts to good use with the illiterate and ignorant villagers. Thus he creates a larger than life figure of himself before them. He has a view on every subject and loves to engage in debate above all with the village priest. He knows that in the eyes of the villagers the conclusion of the debate depends more on noise than on wisdom. Hence he keeps arguing even if he is defeated.Goldsmith’s portrait of his former school master is a tour de force of depiction. He manages to make fun of the schoolmaster’s idiosyncrasies while maintaining reverence and admiration for him. The forte of the poem lies in the way in which Goldsmith has neither idealised nor trivialised the school master. On the other hand, the school master brush stroked to make him more humane.[Article] Poetry Study Aid : The Village School Master Oliver Goldsmith"

Full beautiful, a faery’s child;
Her hair was long, her foot was light,
And her eyes were wild.

I set her on my pacing steed,
And nothing else saw all day long,
For sideways would she lean, and sing
A faery’s song.

I made a garland for her head,
And bracelets too, and fragrant zone;
She look'd at me as she did love,
And made sweet moan.

She found me roots of relish sweet,
And honey wild, and manna dew,
And sure in language strange she said.—
I love thee true.

She took me to her elfin grot,
And there she gaz'd and sighed deep,
And there I shut her wild sad eyes
So kiss'd to sleep.

And there we slumber'd on the moss,
And there I dream'd, ah woe betide!—
The latest dream I ever dream'd
On the cold hill side.

I saw pale kings, and princes too,
Pale warriors, death-pale were they all;
Who cry'd—‘La Belle Dame sans Merci
Hath thee in thrall!’

I saw their starv'd lips in the gloam,
With horrid warning gaped wide,

I've always payed no attention an school and now I blame myself for having troubles understanding texts, poems, even movies. Like there's something crucial, some fundamental basic I'm missing. Like I wouldn't care about all those things.

It's making me furious and I can't find the cause of this. What's more, I've never payed attention to lyrics even in my favorite songs. Is it something wrong with me ? My natural ignorance ? Perhaps I'm just an egoist and maybe that's why I can't understand humanism or something like that?

about *death*; its suddenness,  
its terrible weight,  
its certain coming. Yet under

reason burns a brighter fire, which the bones  
have always preferred.  
It is the story of endless good fortune.

The Game

There's an owl in the valley, fixing his prey.
He's not counting the tally,
it's down to what comes up before the day.
And the trees in the orchard
were taken from a narrow view of time,
where the minds of the tortured
perpetuated patron saints of crime.

I can fit into your puzzle, 
but it's hardly ever a hold.
And I'll tell you the trouble:
the habits I've got
are more than 10,000 years old.
And we cannot sell our souls to learning morals,
Big Brother is no place for us to slide.
We cannot live by numbers, or on laurels,
and hardly on how far from death we hide.

And it's not a case of rampant paranoia,
but just an age I'd love to see unborn.
Not that I'd be missing playing Goya,
but more like I'd feel awkward passing on
civilization down to my children.
Without a question.

While the prophets of freedom,
battery farming brains for narrow minds,
they've decided that meaning
is far beyond the lives they've left behind.
As two thirds of the population dine
on scraps in shadow, lengthening with time.
While propaganda spreads the same old theme.
You is Me, and We can change the Game.
Bullshit.

But how many times have we written these lines,
and delivered these signs, 
but not made it happen.
Walking the tightrope of talking our head off,
losing the rhythm.
Idealizing, and all criticizing,
not realizing that we've changed and left.
And we've gone.

Sad to be leaving the things we believe in,
but time has a way and we fly.
The next age is born, 
and the old hands are gone and done,
in the wink of an eye.  No point in passing bad reason, good guessing. And no time for massing much more than can flourish with love.

And right now my darling, I'm lying here dreaming of feeling no daylight between us.  So wherever you are, and whenever I'm there, is some place we've got to be ours.

Can we right-heartedly
stand in this light and see
what might just turn out to be crazy enough,
enough to be We?

When we've have a past
sad enough to last for some time,
into the future.
These storms have torn and true love is alone,
and the past is almost a failure.
Consciences burn and the programs turn,
computing the social behavior.
But yolk revolts, the foundation bolts,
and cries for yet another savior.

And I'd pack my things on a pair of wings,
and tomorrow I'd be parting.
With the summer birds, and the winter herds,
for a place to face a new heart in.

But it makes no difference where I am,
I'm in the Game first hand.
There are no certain answers, 
and no time to understand.
The rules are set to paradox, 
coercion, and blind faith.
The goal's a changing paradise,
a moment out of date.
The dream is righteous grandeur,
fit to flood the universe.
The fact is more than meets the eye,
but less than runs the Earth.

And the prisoner of the present
paces up and down inside his cell.
He's the living replacement,
somersaulting from the psychic well.
Screaming:
""I'm the sponsor of a Hell.""
Voices, like the sea inside a shell.
Telling me I cannot stake a claim.
Possession is a clue, 
but not the Game.

as clean as when you came.","[Poem] The Game, by Roy Harper",Poetry,"(Roy Harper is an eccentric English poet, singer, and musician known for his unique style.

Possession is a clue, 
but not the Game.

322,"This is not I. I had no body once—  
only what served my need to laugh and run  
and stare at stars and tentatively dance  
on the fringe of foam and wave and sand and sun.  
Eyes loved, hands reached for me, but I was gone  
on my own currents, quicksilver, thistledown.  
Can I be trapped at last in that soft face?  


I stare at you in fear, dark brimming eyes.  
Why do you watch me with that immoderate plea—  
'Look under these curled lashes, recognize  
that you were always here; know me—be me.'  
Smooth once-hermaphrodite shoulders, too tenderly  
your long slope runs, above those sudden shy  
curves furred with light that spring below your space.  


No, I have been betrayed. If I had known  
that this girl waited between a year and a year,  
I'd not have chosen her bough to dance upon.  
Betrayed, by that little darkness here, and here  
this swelling softness and that frightened stare  
from eyes I will not answer; shut out here  
from my own self, by its new body's grace—  


for I am betrayed by someone lovely. Yes,  
I see you are lovely, hateful naked girl.  
Your lips in the mirror tremble as I refuse  
to know or claim you. Let me go—let me be gone.  
You are half of some other who may never come.  
Why should I tend you? You are not my own;  
you seek that other—he will be your home.  


Yet I pity your eyes in the mirror, misted with tears;  
I lean to your kiss. I must serve you; I will obey.  
Some day we may love. I may miss your going, some day,  
though I shall always resent your dumb and fruitful years.  
Your lovers shall learn better, and bitterly too,  
if their arrogance dares to think I am part of you.  ","[POEM] ""Naked Girl and Mirror"" - Judith Wright",Poetry,"This is not I. I had no body once—

323,"I bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers,

From the seas and the streams;

I bear light shade for the leaves when laid

In their noonday dreams.

From my wings are shaken the dews that waken

The sweet buds every one,

When rocked to rest on their mother's breast,

As she dances about the sun.

I wield the flail of the lashing hail,

And whiten the green plains under,

And then again I dissolve it in rain,

And laugh as I pass in thunder.

***

I sift the snow on the mountains below,

And their great pines groan aghast;

And all the night 'tis my pillow white,

While I sleep in the arms of the blast.

Sublime on the towers of my skiey bowers,

Lightning my pilot sits;

In a cavern under is fettered the thunder,

It struggles and howls at fits;

Over earth and ocean, with gentle motion,

This pilot is guiding me,

Lured by the love of the genii that move

In the depths of the purple sea;

Over the rills, and the crags, and the hills,

Over the lakes and the plains,

Wherever he dream, under mountain or stream,

The Spirit he loves remains;

And I all the while bask in Heaven's blue smile,

Whilst he is dissolving in rains.

***

The sanguine Sunrise, with his meteor eyes,

And his burning plumes outspread,

Leaps on the back of my sailing rack,

When the morning star shines dead;

As on the jag of a mountain crag,

Which an earthquake rocks and swings,

An eagle alit one moment may sit

In the light of its golden wings.

And when Sunset may breathe, from the lit sea beneath,

Its ardours of rest and of love,

And the crimson pall of eve may fall

From the depth of Heaven above,

With wings folded I rest, on mine aëry nest,

As still as a brooding dove.

***

That orbèd maiden with white fire laden,

Whom mortals call the Moon,

Glides glimmering o'er my fleece-like floor,

By the midnight breezes strewn;

And wherever the beat of her unseen feet,

Which only the angels hear,

May have broken the woof of my tent's thin roof,

The stars peep behind her and peer;

And I laugh to see them whirl and flee,

Like a swarm of golden bees,

When I widen the rent in my wind-built tent,

Till calm the rivers, lakes, and seas,

Like strips of the sky fallen through me on high,

Are each paved with the moon and these.

***

I bind the Sun's throne with a burning zone,

And the Moon's with a girdle of pearl;

The volcanoes are dim, and the stars reel and swim,

When the whirlwinds my banner unfurl.

From cape to cape, with a bridge-like shape,

Over a torrent sea,

Sunbeam-proof, I hang like a roof,

The mountains its columns be.

The triumphal arch through which I march

With hurricane, fire, and snow,

When the Powers of the air are chained to my chair,

Is the million-coloured bow;

The sphere-fire above its soft colours wove,

While the moist Earth was laughing below.

***

I am the daughter of Earth and Water,

And the nursling of the Sky;

I pass through the pores of the ocean and shores;

I change, but I cannot die.

For after the rain when with never a stain

The pavilion of Heaven is bare,

And the winds and sunbeams with their convex gleams

Build up the blue dome of air,

I silently laugh at my own cenotaph,

And out of the caverns of rain,

Like a child from the womb, like a ghost from the tomb,

I arise and unbuild it again. ","[Poem] ""The Cloud,"" Percy Shelley, 1820",Poetry,"I bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers,

The Wild Iris

there was a door.

Hear me out: that which you call death 

I remember.

Then nothing. The weak sun

out socks, press them flat together,

roll them into neat, tight fists.

sheets I pull from the line—day-

filled blanks—stiff, cool, I

stretch them wide across my breasts.

fourteen but fifty, and thickly warm

as the furnace that holds off winter.

That, for all they care, I can go to hell,

But on earth indifference is the least

We have to dread from man or beast.

With a passion for us we could not return?

If equal affection cannot be,

Let the more loving one be me.

Admirer as I think I am

Of stars that do not give a damn,

I cannot, now I see them, say

I missed one terribly all day.

Were all stars to disappear or die,

I should learn to look at an empty sky

And feel its total dark sublime,

Though this might take me a little time.

345,"What draws you to a poem? 

I know many people want a poem they could see representing themselves, somehow. It might be a love poem that reaches the heights of their infatuation or plumbs the depths of their despair. Or it may be a story about an experience (being an immigrant, being a woman, being a working class man) to which they can relate because they *share* that experience.

Then, there's the possibility of looking for a *new* experience through a poem, wanting to understand another culture or lifestyle (ethnicity, country vs. city) through the emotionally evocative expression of their experience.

I know I tend to be drawn to confessional poets, though I'm trying to break out of my box. Eavan Boland and Margaret Atwood, Sandra Cisneros and other women who liberally throw around first-person pronouns speak to me more often than other poets do. 

I'm trying to branch out to read different things, particularly poems by men or poems that aren't even about people, but rather events or places.

Pet was never mourned as you,

Purrer of the spotless hue,

Plumy tail, and wistful gaze

While you humoured our queer ways,

Or outshrilled your morning call

Up the stairs and through the hall –

Foot suspended in its fall –

While, expectant, you would stand

Arched, to meet the stroking hand;

Till your way you chose to wend

Yonder, to your tragic end.

Better blankness day by day

Than companion torn away.

Better bid his memory fade,

Better blot each mark he made,

Selfishly escape distress

By contrived forgetfulness,

Than preserve his prints to make

Every morn and eve an ache.

***

“From the chair whereon he sat

Sweep his fur, nor wince thereat;

Rake his little pathways out

Mid the bushes roundabout;

Smooth away his talons’ mark

From the claw-worn pine-tree bark,

Where he climbed as dusk embrowned,

Waiting us who loitered round.

“Strange it is this speechless thing,

Subject to our mastering,

Subject for his life and food

To our gift, and time, and mood;

Timid pensioner of us Powers,

His existence ruled by ours,

Should–by crossing at a breath

Into safe and shielded death,

By the merely taking hence

Of his insignificance –

Loom as largened to the sense,

Shape as part, above man’s will,

Of the Imperturbable.

“As a prisoner, flight debarred,

Exercising in a yard,

Still retain I, troubled, shaken,

Mean estate, by him forsaken;

And this home, which scarcely took

Impress from his little look,

By his faring to the Dim

Grows all eloquent of him.

356,"Out here, there's a bowing even the trees are doing.  
Winter's icy hand at the back of all of us.  
Black bark, slick yellow leaves, a kind of stillness that feels  
so mute it's almost in another year.

I am a hearth of spiders these days: a nest of trying.

We point out the stars that make Orion as we take out  
the trash, the rolling containers a song of suburban thunder.

It's almost romantic as we adjust the waxy blue  
recycling bin until you say, *Man , we should really learn*  
*some new constellations.*

And it's true. We keep forgetting Antlia, Centaurus,  
Draco, Lacerta, Hydra, Lyra, Lynx.

But mostly we're forgetting we're dead stars too, my mouth is full  
of dust and I wish to reclaim the rising–

to lean in the spotlight of the streetlight with you, towards  
what's larger within us, toward how we were born.

Look, we are not unspectacular things.   
We've come this far, survived this much. What

would happen if we decided to survive more? To love harder?

What if we stood up with our synapses and flesh and said, *No.*  
*No,* to the rising tides.

Stood for the many mute mouths of the sea, of the land?

What would happen if we used our bodies to bargain

for the safety of others, for earth,  
if we declared a clean night, if we stopped being fearful,

if we launched our demands into the sky, made ourselves so big  
people could point to us with the arrows they make in their minds,

rolling their trash bins out, after all of this is over?

362,"My brother comes home from work   
and climbs the stairs to our room.   
I can hear the bed groan and his shoes drop   
one by one. You can have it, he says. 

The moonlight streams in the window   
and his unshaven face is whitened   
like the face of the moon. He will sleep   
long after noon and waken to find me gone. 

Thirty years will pass before I remember   
that moment when suddenly I knew each man   
has one brother who dies when he sleeps   
and sleeps when he rises to face this life, 

and that together they are only one man   
sharing a heart that always labours, hands   
yellowed and cracked, a mouth that gasps   
for breath and asks, Am I gonna make it? 

All night at the ice plant he had fed   
the chute its silvery blocks, and then I   
stacked cases of orange soda for the children   
of Kentucky, one gray boxcar at a time 

with always two more waiting. We were twenty   
for such a short time and always in   
the wrong clothes, crusted with dirt   
and sweat. I think now we were never twenty. 

In 1948 the city of Detroit, founded   
by de la Mothe Cadillac for the distant purposes   
of Henry Ford, no one wakened or died,   
no one walked the streets or stoked a furnace, 

for there was no such year, and now   
that year has fallen off all the old newspapers,   
calendars, doctors' appointments, bonds   
wedding certificates, drivers licenses. 

The city slept. The snow turned to ice.   
The ice to standing pools or rivers   
racing in the gutters. Then the bright grass rose   
between the thousands of cracked squares, 

and that grass died. I give you back 1948.   
I give you all the years from then   
to the coming one. Give me back the moon   
with its frail light falling across a face. 

Give me back my young brother, hard   
and furious, with wide shoulders and a curse   
for God and burning eyes that look upon   
all creation and say, You can have it.  ","[POEM] ""You Can Have It"" - Philip Levine",Poetry,"My brother comes home from work

366,"Can someone explain to me why poetry is so revered.  When ever I have been forced to learn poetry(mostly in school), I just get confused and angry about it. It seems to me like its just a lost art, mostly locked in its own conventions. I find it is often difficult to understand. Its often restricted in its own conventions, like this has to be a sonnet with this many syllables and this meter ... etc, to the point that it doesn't really convey a coherent message or meaning to me.

I come from a pretty science based background, so I am used to concise objective writing. I'm also think that I am probably spoiled by modern art like photography and film. Which, I think is arguably much more effective at conveying message and meaning.

I understand not all poetry is written with these weird conventions. However, I think the most famous and revered poetry is from 1600-1900, which often uses these weird rules. Also these poems seem so obscure that often the only person who could ever know the meaning is the author. At that point, if a poem is unable to be understood by only one person what is the point of writing it at all? Why not just think it/write it for yourself?

with being so fucking cute?  
Not much longer.  
The shoes with bows, the cunning underwear  
with slogans on the crotch — Knock Here,  
and so forth —  
will have to go, along with the cat suit.  
After a while you forget  
what you really look like.  
You think your mouth is the size it was.  
You pretend not to care.

When I was young I went with my hair  
hiding one eye, thinking myself daring;  
off to the movies in my jaunty pencil  
skirt and elastic cinch-belt,  
chewed gum, left lipstick  
imprints the shape of grateful, rubbery  
sighs on the cigarettes of men  
I hardly knew and didn’t want to.  
Men were a skill, you had to have  
good hands, breathe into  
their nostrils, as for horses. It was something I did well,  
like playing the flute, although I don’t.

In the forests of grey stems there are standing pools,  
tarn-coloured, choked with brown leaves.  
Through them you can see an arm, a shoulder,  
when the light is right, with the sky clouded.  
The train goes past silos, through meadows,  
the winter wheat on the fields like scanty fur.

I still get letters, although not many.  
A man writes me, requesting true-life stories  
about bad sex. He’s doing an anthology.  
He got my name off an old calendar,  
the photo that’s mostly bum and daisies,  
back when my skin had the golden slick  
of fresh-spread margarine.  
Not rape, he says, but disappointment,  
more like a defeat of expectations.  
Dear Sir, I reply, I never had any.  
Bad sex, that is.  
It was never the sex, it was the other things,  
the absence of flowers, the death threats,  
the eating habits at breakfast.  
I notice I’m using the past tense.

Though the vaporous cloud of chemicals that enveloped you  
like a glowing eggshell, an incense,  
doesn’t disappear: it just gets larger  
and takes in more. You grow out  
of sex like a shrunk dress  
into your common senses, those you share  
with whatever’s listening. The way the sun  
moves through the hours becomes important,  
the smeared raindrops  
on the window, buds  
on the roadside weeds, the sheen  
of spilled oil on a raw ditch  
filling with muddy water.

Don’t get me wrong: with the lights out  
I’d still take on anyone,  
if I had the energy to spare.  
But after a while these flesh arpeggios get boring,  
like Bach over and over;  
too much of one kind of glory.

When I was all body I was lazy.  
I had an easy life, and was not grateful.  
Now there are more of me.

378,"When I was a kid I used to think that pork chops and karate chops were the same thing 

I thought they were both pork chops

 My grandmother thought it was cute So she let me keep doing it 

Because you know, they were my favorite It wasn't a big deal 

Until I was seven years old 

And a bad fall caused me to bruise my upper arm and shoulder rather severely 

I didn't wana tell my grandmother what happened Because I was afraid I would get in trouble 

Because I was playing somewhere I shouldn't have been

 One day in gym class the teacher notices the bruise And I was sent to the principals office Not long after that I ended up in another small room With a really nice lady who asked me all sorts of questions about my life at home I saw no reason to lie 

It was pretty good as far as i was concerned So I told her, whenever I'm sad my grandmother gives me karate chops

 This lead to a full scale investigation And I was removed from my grandparents house for three days And then returned when they finally asked me how I got the bruises News of this silly little story eventually spread through the school And when the students finally caught wind of it I earned my first name Pork Chop

 To this day I fucking hate pork chops

 I'm not the only kid Who grew up this way

 Surrounded by people who used to say That rhyme about sticks and stones 

As if broken bones Hurt more than the names we got called And we got called them all

 So we grew up believing no one Would ever fall in love with us 

That we'd be lonely forever That we'd never meet someone To make us feel like the sun Was something they built for us In their tool shed 

So broken heart strings bled the blues As we tried to empty ourselves

 So we would feel nothing Don't tell me that hurts less than a broken bone

 That an ingrown life Is something surgeons can cut away 

That there's no way for it to metastasize It does 

She was eight years old 

Our first day of grade three When she got called ugly 

We both got moved to the back of the class So we would stop getting bombarded by spit balls 

But the school halls were a battleground We found ourselves outnumbered day after day 

We used to stay inside for recess Because outside was worse

 Outside we'd have to rehearse running away Or learn to stay still like statues giving no clues that we were there

 In grade five they taped a sign to the front of her desk That read ""Beware Of Dog""

 To this day despite a loving husband She doesn't think she's beautiful

 Because of a birthmark That takes up a little less than half of her face 

Kids used to say she looks like a wrong answer That someone tried to erase But couldn't quite get the job done 

And they'll never understand That she's raising two kids Whose definition of beauty Begins with the word mom

 Because they see her heart Before they see her skin Because she's only ever always been amazing 

He Was a broken branch Grafted onto a different family tree

 Adopted

 But not because his parents opted for a different destiny 

He was three when he became a mixed drink Of one part left alone And two parts tragedy

 Started therapy in 8th grade

 Had a personality made up of tests and pills 
Lived like the uphills were mountains And the downhills were cliffs

 Four fifths suicidal A tidal wave of anti depressants And an adolescence of being called popper 

One part because of the pills And ninety nine parts because of the cruelty

 He tried to kill himself in grade ten When a kid who could still go home to mom and dad Had the audacity to tell him ""get over it"" 

As if depression is something that can be remedied By any of the contents found in a first aid kit

 To this day he is a stick of TNT lift from both ends Could describe you in detail the way the sky bends

 In the moments before it's about to fall And despite an army of friends Who all call him an inspiration 

He remains a conversation piece between people Who can't understand That sometimes becoming drug free Has less to do with addiction And more to do with sanity

We weren't the only kids who grew up this way

 To this day kids are still being called names The classics were ""Hey stupid"" ""Hey spaz"" Seems like every school has an arsenal of names Getting updated every year 

And if a kid breaks in a school And no one around chooses to hear 

Do they make a sound? 

Are they just the background noise Of a soundtrack stuck on repeat When people say things like Kids can be cruel? 

Every school was a big top circus tent And the pecking order went From acrobats to lion tamers From clowns to carnies 

All of these were miles ahead of who we were We were freaks Lobster claw boys and bearded ladies 

Oddities Juggling depression and loneliness playing solitaire spin the bottle Trying to kiss the wounded parts of ourselves and heal 

But at night While the others slept We kept walking the tightrope It was practice

 And yeah Some of us fell But I wanna tell them That all of this Is just debris Leftover when we finally decide to smash all the things we thought We used to be 

And if you can't see anything beautiful about yourself Get a better mirror 

Look a little closer 

Stare a little longer 

Because there's something inside you That made you keep trying Despite everyone who told you to quit 

You built a cast around your broken heart And signed it yourself You signed it ""They were wrong"" 

Because maybe you didn't belong to a group or a click 

Maybe they decided to pick you last for basketball or everything 

Maybe you used to bring bruises and broken teeth To show and tell but never told Because 

how can you hold your ground If everyone around you wants to bury you beneath it 

You have to believe that they were wrong 

They have to be wrong Why else we'd still be here? We grew up learning to cheer on the underdog Because we see ourselves in them

 We stem from a root planted in the belief That we are not what we were called We are not abandoned cars stalled out and Sitting empty on some highway 

And if in some way we are Don't worry We only got out to walk and get gas 

We are graduating members from the class of we made it

 Not the faded echoes of voices crying out Names will never hurt me 

Of course They did 

But our lives will only ever always Continue to be A balancing act

Toiled in the sun, lolled in the shade,   
Here they mudded out the brook   
And here their hatchet cleared the glade:  
Harvest-supper woke their wit,  
Huntsmen's moon their wooings lit.  

From this church they led their brides,   
From this church themselves were led   
Shoulder-high; on these waysides.  
Sat to take their beer and bread.   
Names are gone - what men they were   
These their cottages declare.   

Names are vanished, save the few   
In the old brown Bible scrawled;   
These were men of pith and thew,   
Whom the city never called;   
Scarce could read or hold a quill,   
Built the barn, the forge, the mill.   

On the green they watched their sons   
Playing till too dark to see,   
As their fathers watched them once,   
As my father once watched me;   
While the bat and beetle flew   
On the warm air webbed with dew.   

Unrecorded, unrenowned,   
Men from whom my ways begin,   
Here I know you by your ground   
But I know you not within -   
There is silence, there survives   
Not a moment of your lives.   

Like the bee that now is blown   
Honey-heavy on my hand,   
From his toppling tansy-throne   
In the green tempestuous land -   
I'm in clover now, nor know   
Who made honey long ago.

When things go wrong, as they sometimes will;  
When the road you're trudging seems all uphill;

When all is pressing down a bit.  
Rest if you must, but don't you quit.  
Success is failure turned inside out;  
The silver tint on the clouds of doubt;  
And you can never tell how close you are;  
It may be near when it seems far.

393,"Can anyone help decipher the meaning of each line in this poem? Especially the first one, as what does it mean to ""crash""?

It’s easier to computer than to crash. It’s easier to computer than to hold a hand or knit a winter together from headlights on the highway. 

It’s easier to computer and be a hybrid and cross from bowels and eardrums into hours lit and roaring by like freight. The chapters

there can tell you an octopus has three hearts,that snails breathe through their feet. It is easier to have no arms or breath, to position through

colors and jumps shoreless as steam. No surfaces. No verbs to be. No mussels or bellows or congestion or caffeine.

No lens to focus, no Rome to burn. Who can do when the roots are so untidy and the branches rack like antlers against other

branches. It’s easier to computer than to guess at a savior. Than to whisper slips of information to the flesh. Let language construct

mere dewdrops of light. Let the circuitry gauge the need and make it clean and make it so heady it is erected, a remedy, in its ease.

There is no destination. No grave in place of a person loved in the past, no identity classified, factual, no glass to break open in the fisted hand, no cracked windshield,

no hurricane. Or there is, but it is closed inside its box smaller than the box for roses, dead and moldered by the time they reach the door, delivered only once.",I want to understand this poem fully.

I just wanted to express my love toward the whole poetry community after it probably saved my life ❤️.

So a few months ago (without going into too much details I have others posts about that) everything in my life went to shit. I was/is severely depressed with pretty intense anxiety issues and started writing poetry a lot more than before. After one of my friend found one of my poems ans read it, he encouraged me to post them somewhere and I did. I started posting my poems under and alias in some poetry community apps such as poetizer and one Instagram and even though my profiles are really small, the people following me were really appreciating my stuff and sending a lot of love through dms and it's really all I needed at the moment.

I just wanted to express my love toward the whole poetry community after it probably saved my life ❤️.

So a few months ago (without going into too much details I have others posts about that) everything in my life went to shit. I was/is severely depressed with pretty intense anxiety issues and started writing poetry a lot more than before. After one of my friend found one of my poems ans read it, he encouraged me to post them somewhere and I did. I started posting my poems under and alias in some poetry community apps such as poetizer and one Instagram and even though my profiles are really small, the people following me were really appreciating my stuff and sending a lot of love through dms and it's really all I needed at the moment.

Are there any books or resources that go over the ""heart"" of writing poetry? We see a lot of times books on forms and structure but never any about how to live like a poet in terms of how we make sense of our emotions and how we process the stimuli in light of our writing. I ask as a lyricist and songwriter looking to become more in tune with myself. I feel like I have become so focused on the musician aspect of songwriting that I forgot the self expression aspect. I personally grew up in a family where expressing your emotions wasn't really something we did. We either laughed it off or never talked about it, so I feel like this has stunted me as a writer.

412,"I remember having it read to me by a teacher in a Catholic school (although I don't think there was a religious link) in 2011/12.

The poem is about a woman who came from either Africa or Asia and she was telling her children about this amazing fruit she loved as a child, how juicy it was and how terribly she wished she could have it again.

Then one day she's at the market and she sees this fruit, she jumps on the tram (I think) and rushes home to let her children have a try of this wondrous fruit and. then when they try it they're disgusted. I specifically remember one of them saying it tastes like sawdust.

The woman is shocked and she tells them there's no way it could be true, but as soon as she bites into it she realises it isn't how she remembered it at all and she hates it. I think there's a part about her wishing she hadn't tried it because it ruined her memories of it the first time around.

PHRASES

When the world is reduced to a single dark wood for our two pairs of dazzled eyes—to a beach for two faithful children—to a musical house for our clear understanding—then I shall find you.

When there is only one old man on earth, lonely, peaceful, handsome, living in unsurpassed luxury, then I am at your feet.

When I have realized all your memories, —when I am the girl who can tie your hands,—then I will stifle you.

When we are very strong, who draws back? or very happy, who collapses from ridicule? When we are very bad, what can they do to us.

Dress up, dance, laugh. I will never be able to throw Love out of the window.

—Comrade of mine, beggar girl, monstrous child! How little you care about the wretched women, and the machinations and my embarrassment. Join us with your impossible voice, oh your voice! the one flatterer of this base despair.

A dark morning in July. The taste of ashes in the air, the smell of wood sweating in the hearth, steeped flowers, the devastation of paths, drizzle over the canals in the fields, why not already playthings and incense?

I stretched out ropes from spire to spire; garlands from window to window; golden chains from star to star, and I dance.

The high pond is constantly streaming. What witch will rise up against the white sunset? What purple flowers are going to descend?        

While public funds disappear in brotherly celebrations, a bell of pink are rings in the clouds.

Arousing a pleasant taste of Chinese ink, a black powder gently rains on my night, —I lower the jets of the chandelier, throw myself on the bed, and turning toward the dark, I see you, O my daughters and queens!

Home is the place where the laughter should ring,

And man should be found at his best.

Let the cares of the day be as great as they may,

The night has been fashioned for rest.

So leave at the door when the toiling is o'er

All the burdens of worktime behind,

And just be a dad to your girl or your lad--

A dad of the rollicking kind.




The office is made for the tasks you must face;

It is built for the work you must do;

You may sit there and sigh as your cares pile up high,

And no one may criticize you;

You may worry and fret as you think of your debt,

You may grumble when plans go astray,

But when it comes night, and you shut your desk tight,

Don't carry the burdens away.




Keep daytime for toil and the nighttime for play,

Work as hard as you choose in the town,

But when the day ends, and the darkness descends,

Just forget that you're wearing a frown--

Go home with a smile! Oh, you'll find it worth while;

Go home light of heart and of mind;

Go home and be glad that you're loved as a dad,

A dad of the fun-loving kind.

And just be a dad to your girl or your lad--

A dad of the rollicking kind.




The office is made for the tasks you must face;

It is built for the work you must do;

You may sit there and sigh as your cares pile up high,

And no one may criticize you;

You may worry and fret as you think of your debt,

You may grumble when plans go astray,

But when it comes night, and you shut your desk tight,

Don't carry the burdens away.




Keep daytime for toil and the nighttime for play,

Work as hard as you choose in the town,

But when the day ends, and the darkness descends,

Just forget that you're wearing a frown--

Go home with a smile! Oh, you'll find it worth while;

Go home light of heart and of mind;

Go home and be glad that you're loved as a dad,

A dad of the fun-loving kind.

Hi there,  

I’m an individual looking to help the community of poets and lyricists. I’m conducting a little bit of research to find out if my idea of a new text editor based around poetry and lyrics would be of use to people. I am posting this with a link to survey monkey for your community to help me gather information on whether this is something I should pursue or not.  

Your responses would be greatly appreciated, it should only take around 10 minutes to complete. I have my own style of writing and composition that inspired me to think of an idea for a text editor, however I’m looking to see how other people compose their poems / lyrics. Please feel free to forward the link to others who may also be interested.  

You do not have to submit any personally identifying information, however there is an option to enter in your email address (which is optional) if you would like to be contacted in the future by me – this information will only be used in the event I go forward with my idea, and will be used to give updates and potentially beta access to the software for feedback.

[Old 1800s poem from the North of Ireland](https://i.redd.it/slunrmq2szh21.jpg)

'The Auld Whiskey Bar at the Bridge' is an old recently found 1899 poem written by a man in Broughshane, in the North of Ireland.

The poet describes, often in local Irish-Scots words of the time, how he and his friends liked to enjoy their nights at the local bar.

&gt;My chums and I often go out on the spree,  
When we hae an odd shilling we let it go free.  
Each Saturday night, let it snaw or sleet,  
We visit the pub, at the heid of the street.  
A drop by a time, we think it no harm,  
On a cold winter’s night sure it keeps a chap warm  
If it wasnae the peelers whiles gives us a scar,  
We would booze for a week at the auld whiskey bar.

446,"Hello every one, I don't know if this is the right place to post this but, I have a chance to do something I've always wanted to do, prove a teacher wrong.

I pretty much have all the proof I need, but I need a strong and convincing way to say it.

We are reviewing ""The Tyger"" by William Blake. And my teacher wanted to briefly touch on meter. so she used the first line of that poem as an example The line is ""Tyger! Tyger! Burning bright""

She Scanned the first three words as Trochaic feet, but ""bright"" she said was just one stressed syllable with the unstress mark just was on nothing. My understanding was that you had to have every syllable in the poem fall exclusively under a foot such as an iamb, trochee, anapest, dactyl or spondee.

Personally I don't even think ""The Tyger"" is a metered poem, but it could be.

And I'm not trying to be malicious about it in any way. But the way she brushed me off with a ""do some research and get back to me"" when i brought up what I thought could be a mistake, made me very determined. And the only reason I know all of this is because of other amazing teachers in my life. I love teachers.

so I think the only way the first line could be scanned is in tri meter with the last foot, containing burning bright, has to be a dactylic foot.

So how can I succinctly tell her that all syllables need to be accounted for in a metered a poem.

Currently my text book says ""The foot is the metrical unit by which a line of poetry is measured. A foot usually consists of one stressed and one or two unstressed syllables. A foot in poetry can be arranged in a variety of patterns here are five of the chief ones...."" and it lists the feet I listed above

I also took a picture for future reference, just to make sure. it is attached

As you can see she just left the last unstressed mark hanging in mid air

if I'm wrong I will admit it

It's come to our attention that the TAG system that our subreddit has used for the last few years could use an update. Many of you have suggested that the TAGS we have aren't particularly unique, and the whole system as it exists, wasn't really as useful as it could be, as a result.


So, we're implementing some changes to it, starting in the next couple of days. 


*****

#What’s Changing? 


TAGS will still exist. They're a useful way to sort our subreddit's history, and find similar discussions relating to your individual needs. 


But the TAGS that we will be using from here forward will be a little different. We are removing some which seemed to be seldom, if ever used, like [AMA], and redefining a few others, to make it more clear which TAG is the appropriate one for the content you want to post. 


We hope that this remodel will result in greater functionality, easier and more robust searches, a more user-friendly interface, and a more enjoyable experience for our growing user base of subscribers. 


The full list of new and improved TAGS are listed below. There are 8 of them in total: [Poem], [Article], [Opinion], [Resource], [Help], [Promo], [Opportunity], and [Meta]. These TAGS were chosen based on how the majority of users actually interact with us, and should fit 99% or more of the content that appears on our Subreddit. For those few edge cases that don't, we will handle them on a case-by-case basis. 

So, without further ado, here are the new TAGS:


******


#1. [POEM]: 


For sharing a published or anthologized POEM. (Not for sharing your own amateur poetry.) 


*Examples: “The Road Less Travelled” by Robert Frost, or a haiku by Bashô*

#2. [ARTICLE]: 


For sharing a link to an ARTICLE from the general world of poetry. 


*Examples: a news article about the death of Mary Oliver, or a link to this year's Pushcart Prize recipients.*


#3. [OPINION]: 


For discussing your OPINIONS about any aspect of the general world of poetry. 


*Examples: Thoughts about a particular poet, poem, or poetic technique.*

#4. [RESOURCE]: 


For sharing outside links to RESOURCES that are related to the general world of poetry. 


*Examples: a rhyming dictionary, or a social poetry app.*

#5. [HELP]: 


For asking for HELP from the poetry community. (Still not for sharing your own amateur poetry.) 


*Examples: homework help, or requests for help finding a half-remembered poem.*

#6. [PROMO]: 


For PROMOTING your own creative project. (Still not for sharing your own amateur poetry). 


*Examples: Your published book, or your poem published in a poetry magazine.*


#7. [OPPORTUNITY]: 


For announcements about professional OPPORTUNITIES for prospective poets. 


*Examples: Calls for submission or paid writing jobs.*

#8. [META]: 


For discussing the subreddit itself, or discussing other posts that appear on the subreddit. Posts using this tag may be subject to moderator approval. If in doubt, please ask first. 


*Examples: Changes to the site layout, or Proposed changes to the subreddit rules.* 


*****


#How Do I Use TAGS? 


Use these TAGS any time you submit a post to the Subreddit. The TAG should appear anywhere in the title of your post, and should be surrounded by square brackets. Any post title that does not contain a valid TAG will be removed automatically, and you will have to resubmit using a valid TAG. TAGS are not case sensitive. For instance, all of these are valid post titles: 


- “2018 Pushcart Prizes Awarded [ARTICLE]”


- “[HeLp]! What's The Name Of This Poem?”


- “Please Write A Poem [opportunity] For My Wedding!”

TAGS will still exist. They're a useful way to sort our subreddit's history, and find similar discussions relating to your individual needs. 


But the TAGS that we will be using from here forward will be a little different. We are removing some which seemed to be seldom, if ever used, like [AMA], and redefining a few others, to make it more clear which TAG is the appropriate one for the content you want to post. 


We hope that this remodel will result in greater functionality, easier and more robust searches, a more user-friendly interface, and a more enjoyable experience for our growing user base of subscribers. 


The full list of new and improved TAGS are listed below. There are 8 of them in total: [Poem], [Article], [Opinion], [Resource], [Help], [Promo], [Opportunity], and [Meta]. These TAGS were chosen based on how the majority of users actually interact with us, and should fit 99% or more of the content that appears on our Subreddit. For those few edge cases that don't, we will handle them on a case-by-case basis. 

So, without further ado, here are the new TAGS:


******


#1. [POEM]: 


For sharing a published or anthologized POEM. (Not for sharing your own amateur poetry.) 


*Examples: “The Road Less Travelled” by Robert Frost, or a haiku by Bashô*

#2. [ARTICLE]: 


For sharing a link to an ARTICLE from the general world of poetry. 


*Examples: a news article about the death of Mary Oliver, or a link to this year's Pushcart Prize recipients.*


#3. [OPINION]: 


For discussing your OPINIONS about any aspect of the general world of poetry. 


*Examples: Thoughts about a particular poet, poem, or poetic technique.*

#4. [RESOURCE]: 


For sharing outside links to RESOURCES that are related to the general world of poetry. 


*Examples: a rhyming dictionary, or a social poetry app.*

#5. [HELP]: 


For asking for HELP from the poetry community. (Still not for sharing your own amateur poetry.) 


*Examples: homework help, or requests for help finding a half-remembered poem.*

#6. [PROMO]: 


For PROMOTING your own creative project. (Still not for sharing your own amateur poetry). 


*Examples: Your published book, or your poem published in a poetry magazine.*


#7. [OPPORTUNITY]: 


For announcements about professional OPPORTUNITIES for prospective poets. 


*Examples: Calls for submission or paid writing jobs.*

#8. [META]: 


For discussing the subreddit itself, or discussing other posts that appear on the subreddit. Posts using this tag may be subject to moderator approval. If in doubt, please ask first. 


*Examples: Changes to the site layout, or Proposed changes to the subreddit rules.* 


*****


#How Do I Use TAGS? 


Use these TAGS any time you submit a post to the Subreddit. The TAG should appear anywhere in the title of your post, and should be surrounded by square brackets. Any post title that does not contain a valid TAG will be removed automatically, and you will have to resubmit using a valid TAG. TAGS are not case sensitive. For instance, all of these are valid post titles: 


- “2018 Pushcart Prizes Awarded [ARTICLE]”


- “[HeLp]! What's The Name Of This Poem?”


- “Please Write A Poem [opportunity] For My Wedding!”

455,"""The TV set whose picture works rides on top

   the tv whose sound does. The stations

   change with a needle nose pliers.

From the bed, where he lies most the day,

draggle sheets flecked with holes

where his ashes have dropped.

Every surface is covered with the fuzz of ash, 

punctuated by twisted cigarette packs. 

His teeth hurt him to wear. From a chair seat

they grin at a crowd of Coke cans.

Here's the Bible he chants from at night, his third

and mustard, a plastic knife to spread it with.

And look, new T-shirts, new socks. A roll of stamps 

and paper, a phone card, an address book

where I've written all our numbers.

When I've unloaded the packages, and he has eaten

everything at once, breathing hard, spitting cherry 

pits into his fist,

&amp;#x200B;

When reading poetry, I find myself drawn to works like this. It makes me wonder if I actually just enjoy short stories. It's not that I don't read the kind of short, impactful works that could ONLY be considered poetry. I do read those, and i thoroughly enjoy them. However, I don't like the kind of extensive metaphor ""a rose is like a blah blah blah"" style, just my opinion. I find my self enjoying poems that read more like short stories, because they feel more realistic. As if the poet is simply telling you how things are, and you are allowed to make your own assumptions, and your own feelings. I feel like nothing I am typing right now is making any sense.

Essentially I am saying I enjoy the kind of poetry that leaves me wondering more about the ""characters"" highlighted, opposed to the kind that leaves me wondering how the hell a bolero reminds someone of a fir tree. You feel?

Thoughts?

456,"So this is a topic I've been curious about for quite a while, and surprisingly there isn't that much on Google about it.

A symptom of bipolar disorder is having ""delusions of grandeur"", which Psych Central describes as ""fixed, false belief that one possesses superior qualities such as genius, fame, omnipotence, or wealth"". I was recently diagnosed  and came to the realization that my delusions are centered around art, specifically poetry.

Not out of self indulgence, I was curious about how bipolar played a role in the lives and works of famous poets who were diagnosed. As in, did their ""delusions"" (outdated word) revolve around the success of their poetry? Were they aware of it and how did they address their illness in their works? In specific cases, was there a noticeable shift in their writings after going on medication? Also, were there any poets who were bipolar or of a similar diagnosis, but was never prevalent in their poetry? 

Because as far as I am aware, it is most prevalent in confessional poetry. Anne Sexton is a prime example, with their most famous works being about depression and suicide. I always recall one of the last poems she wrote and published posthumously, where she discusses ""escaping Dr. Death"", but then committing suicide months later. There isn't much talk about the ""delusions"" she experienced, or the drive she had to live. Robert Lowell is another notable example, with him being one of the earliest confessional poets and it being a discussion point, but was wondering who else and if they had any idealization of writing groundbreaking poetry.

I destroy homes, tear families apart, take your children, and that's just the start.

I live with the rich, I live with the poor, I live down the street, and maybe next door. My power is awesome; try me you'll see, but if you do, you may never break free. Just try me once and I might let you go, but try me twice, and I'll own your soul. When I possess you, you'll steal and you'll lie. You do what you have to just to get high. The crimes you'll commit, for my narcotic charms will be worth the pleasure you'll feel in your arms. You'll lie to your mother; you'll steal from your dad When you see their tears, you should feel sad. But you'll forget your morals and how you were raised, I'll be your conscience, I'll teach you my ways. I take kids from parents, and parents from kids, I turn people from God, and separate from friends. I'll take everything from you, your looks and your pride, I'll be with you always, right by your side. You'll give up everything your family, your home, your friends, your money, then you'll be alone. I'll take and take, till you have nothing more to give. When I'm finished with you you'll be lucky to live. If you try me be warned this is no game. If given the chance, I'll drive you insane. I'll ravish your body; I'll control your mind. I'll own you completely; your soul will be mine. The nightmares I'll give you while lying in bed, the voices you'll hear from inside your head, the sweats, the shakes, the visions you'll see; I want you to know, these are all gifts from me, But then it's too late, and you'll know in your heart, that you are mine, and we shall not part. You'll regret that you tried me, they always do, but you came to me, not I to you. You knew this would happen. Many times you were told, but you challenged my power, and chose to be bold. You could have said no, and just walked away, If you could live that day over, now what would you say? I'll be your master; you will be my slave, I'll even go with you, when you go to your grave. Now that you have met me, what will you do? Will you try me or not? Its all up to you. I can bring you more misery than words can tell. Come take my hand, let me lead you to hell.

You could have said no, and just walked away, If you could live that day over, now what would you say? I'll be your master; you will be my slave, I'll even go with you, when you go to your grave. Now that you have met me, what will you do? Will you try me or not? Its all up to you. I can bring you more misery than words can tell. Come take my hand, let me lead you to hell.

475,"Hey everyone!

So, I have a question, and I wasn't able to find much about it through a search.

Can a poet make a name for him- or herself anywhere?

I'm in a fairly fortunate position where I can do my day job pretty much anywhere in the country (US), and I'm coming to a point where I'm considering moving. I've also recently (last 2 years) started taking my poetry more seriously. I've been working on my writing and trying to develop my skills. I want to work on getting published next and maybe eventually submitting to some respected contests. 

Can my location hinder my growth as a poet? Do I have to be in or even near a big city? I really would prefer to stay away from any massive cities. Too expensive and anxiety inducing. What role does the internet play in leveling the playing field in a geographical sense? Does anyone here have experience with being a poet from a smaller town and getting your work out there and recognized? Any famous examples of this?

Our lives are not aliens nor as strangers join,

Moved to each other by a causeless force.

Across dividing Time and, on life's roads

Absorbed wrapped traveler, turning it recovers

Familiar splendours in an unknown face

And touched by the warning finger of swift love

It thrills again to an immortal joy

Wearing a mortal body for delight.

There is a Power within that knows beyond

Our knowings; we are greater than our thoughts,

And sometimes earth unveils that vision here.

Love is a glory from eternity's spheres.

483,"Most people don't understand meter as well as they think (I certainly didn't for a long time!), and in this post I am going to provide a compact summary of the technical principles of iambic pentameter.

So, here's a simple definition of iambic pentameter: it is a line of five beats, where the beat lands on every other syllable; and in which a beat can be either pulled back one syllable, or pushed forward one syllable under certain conditions.

Here is an unvaried line, which I have split up into ""feet"" (metrical units containing one beat):-

&gt;When **I** | do **count** | the **clock** | that **tells** | the **time**

&gt;di-**dum** | di-**dum** | di-**dum** | di-**dum** | di-**dum**

Here is an example of a beat being pulled *back* one syllable:-

&gt;**Now** is the **time** | that **face** | should **form** | a**no**ther

&gt;**dum**-di-di-**dum** | di-**dum** | di-**dum** | di-**dum**-di

This “**dum**-di-di-**dum**” pattern is a swinging movement from one post to the next (and for this reason, it is important not to pause too heavily after the first syllable, as this will destroy the rhythmic swinging movement).

This line also contains a ""feminine ending"": an extra unstressed syllable at the end of the line (“di-**dum**-di”, instead of “di-**dum**”).

And here is an example of a beat being pushed *forward* one syllable:-

&gt;A**ffec** | tion, **puh**. | You **speak** | like a **green** **girl**

&gt;di-**dum** | di-**dum** | di-**dum** | di-di-**dum**-**dum**

Just to confuse you, there is also one very particular (and less frequent) metrical pattern that combines a displaced beat with a *spondee*. A spondee occurs when an *offbeat* syllable is stressed: “**dum**-**dum**”, instead of “di-**dum**”. Here’s an example of two consecutive spondees:-

&gt;**Rich** **gifts** | **wax** **poor** | when **gi** | vers **prove** | un**kind**

The beat is marked by every *other* syllable (“**gifts**”, “**poor**”, “**g**i-”, “**prove**”, “-**kind**”), however, the offbeat syllables “**Rich**” and “**wax**” *also* receive stress, creating a heavy emphasis which commands our attention. Even more emphatic is this rare example of *three* consecutive spondees:-

&gt;**Thoughts** **black**, | **hands** **apt**, | **drugs** **fit**, | and **time** | a**gree**ing

Now, as I said, there is one unique metrical pattern which *combines* a displaced beat with a spondee: normally, when a beat is pulled back one syllable, it creates the pattern “**dum**-di-di-**dum**” (as in “**Now** is the **time**…”); however, when this displaced beat is combined with a spondee, it creates the pattern “**dum**-di-**dum**-**dum**”:-

&gt;**Claps** her **pale** **cheek**, | till **cla** | pping **makes** | it **red**

&gt;**dum**-di-**dum**-**dum** | di-**dum** | di-**dum** | di-**dum**

Both this pattern and the “di-di-**dum**-**dum**” pattern created when a beat is pushed forward one syllable are lopsided metrical figures (they lack the symmetrical balance of the swinging “**dum**-di-di-**dum**” pattern), and therefore need the support of a grammatical structure if they are not to disrupt the rhythm. The grammatical structure for the “**dum**-di-**dum**-**dum**” pattern is often (though not always) the very one from the previous quote:-

Verb (“**Claps**”) / small connecting word (in this case, the pronoun “her”) / monosyllabic adjective (“**pale**”) / noun (“**cheek**”)

And the “di-di-**dum**-**dum**” pattern often follows the exact same grammatical structure on the last three syllables (small connecting word / monosyllabic adjective / noun). Here’s a line that contains both patterns:

&gt;**Pluck** the **keen** **teeth** | from the **fierce** **ti** | ger’s **jaws**

&gt;**dum**-di-**dum**-**dum** | di-di-**dum**-**dum** | di-**dum**

It is also important to note that when a beat is pulled back (creating the pattern “**dum**-di-di-**dum**”; or “**dum**-di-**dum**-**dum**” when combined with a spondee) the displaced beat needs to be placed either at the opening of the line or after a break within the line: if it is not preceded by a break, the displaced beat is not clearly recognisable as such. Here’s an example of the “**dum**-di-**dum**-**dum**” pattern occurring mid-line (and also a very nice example of how expressive metrical variation can be):-

&gt;From **an** | cient **grudge** | **break** to **new** **mu** | tiny

&gt;di-**dum** | di-**dum** | **dum**-di-**dum**-**dum** | di-di

Though there is no punctuation mark, there is a clear phrasal break and natural pause after the word “**grudge**” (“From **an**cient **grudge** / **break** to **new** **mu**tiny”). In this case, the break is marked by the emphatic displaced beat on the *word* “**break**”! Which also echoes the “**an**cient **grudge**” through assonance: the shared vowel sound of “**break**” and “**an**cient”. And the spondee, too, is given heightened emphasis through assonance: the shared “u” sound of “**new** **mu**tiny”.

In this line, the final beat is *de*stressed, creating the flourish of two light syllables at the end. When you have a destressed beat (“di-di”, instead of “di-**dum**”), this is known as a *pyrrhic* (the “y” is pronounced with a short “i” sound, as in “tip”). In this case, it is an *appended* pyrrhic: a pyrrhic at the end of a word (“**mu**-ti-ny”). Normally, any pyrrhic at the end of a line or before a line break is an appended pyrrhic. When there is no line break, the pyrrhic joins with the following foot to form a run of light syllables, which provide heightened emphasis to the next stressed beat: instead of “di-**dum**-di-**dum**”, we have the pattern “di-di-di-**dum**” (in the following line, not everyone would stress the opening word “My”, but in the context of the passage, I feel it’s an effective reading):-

&gt;**My** **boun** | ty is as **bound** | less as the **sea**

&gt;**dum**-**dum** | di-di-di-**dum** | di-di-di-**dum**

The beat syllables “is” and “as” are destressed, creating runs of light syllables which serve to highlight the stressed beats on “**bound**less” (echoing “**boun**ty”) and “**sea**”.

I hope that wasn’t too much to follow: if anything needs clarification, please feel free to ask!

If you find that you're struggling to work out how a line fits the meter, it's best to start at the end of the line and work backwards. It will often be a matter of working out the syllable count: some words can be either expanded, contracted or glided together to fit the meter - even more so in Shakespeare's day (and in this post, I explore the principles of expansion and contraction quite thoroughly: https://versemeter.wordpress.com/2018/04/23/making-the-words-fit-the-meter/). Examples of expansions in Shakespeare include the pronunciation of the '-ed' suffix as a separate syllable, and the stretching out of '-tion' or '-ssion' into two syllables (with the short “i” pronounced separately). One common contraction is that of words with a medial 'v', e.g. ""Heav'n"", instead of ""Heaven"". He became much bolder with his contractions in his later plays, which is why there’s a mistaken perception that his meter became more irregular. Reading the line out loud, with pace, can often make it easier to identify where a contraction might occur. Feel free to ask me how to scan the meter of a line you're having difficulty with.

Thank you all so much. ",[HELP] Does anyone know some good political poets?,Poetry," Hello y'all! First time poster to this sub. I have a literature project due soon, and I need a poem to analyze.

487,"Hi, friends-

​

I shouldn't need help with this question, but I do. I need to hear your advice, so I can follow it.

​

I'd like to begin reading poetry, making it a regular diet of my life, but it's a struggle for me.

​

First, in selecting poetry, I choose huge volumes of works (The Complete Works of Emily D.). I'll read a couple poems, become overwhelmed by the weight of pages remaining, and toss it aside.

​

Second, I'll read a poem, ponder it, ponder it, feel like I should be getting more out of it, decide to wait until the poem's every secret steps into the light, and then...set the book aside.

​

How should I read poetry? I've taken classes on poetry before, so I'm no dunce, and I read fiction and non-fiction, but my perfectionist, analytical side makes regular reading of poetry difficult. What would you suggest? Can you point me to any advice?

493,"I was asked this question by someone who is interested in writing poetry but I don't know how to directly answer since I have no full experience in this: ""I noticed that some people online, especially those who post their poems on youtube are cool with asking donations to support their work. When is this okay, or when does it start being okay to do it?""

Note: I get that for those who aspire to be writers or poets, we all need to have our work out there, and by out there i mean journals, publications, joining slams, building your platform both online and inside the poetry/literary community near you. I also get that poetry in itself isn't profitable, but let's face it you can still earn a bit of money on the side which is something that's not gained from doing something illegally.

Do people still support making Zines, or chapbooks or it depends on the event/place if you can sell them or give them away for free? 

I guess the better question is when should you consider your poetry as a poetry meant to be shared for free and when do you think you should get at least a little bit of monetary support in making them?",[Discussion] when is it ok to ask for monetary help for your written work?,Poetry,"I was asked this question by someone who is interested in writing poetry but I don't know how to directly answer since I have no full experience in this: ""I noticed that some people online, especially those who post their poems on youtube are cool with asking donations to support their work.
