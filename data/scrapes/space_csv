1,"Hi. That's all I have time to answer today. Thank you for all the questions. And please keep following our coverage at usatoday.com. 

Hi, everybody. I’m the Washington Bureau chief of USA TODAY. I’ve covered 10 presidential campaigns, interviewed nine presidents, and reported from six continents. Now I’ve written my first book, titled THE MATRIARCH: Barbara Bush and the Making of an American Dynasty, published April 2 by Twelve Books. Barbara Bush was somebody who millions of Americans thought they knew well, and loved. But in fact she was more complicated that her public persona, and she was more influential that almost anybody acknowledged. She was consequential – as the historic wife and mother of presidents, of course, but also as someone with strong views about what was right and wrong and important. And her lifetime spanned an era of dramatically changing opportunities and expectations for women. All that is why I wanted to tell her story. I spent a fair amount of time with her during the final six months of her life, and she eventually gave me rare access to her private diaries. They were amazing. [USA TODAY has run the first excerpt from THE MATRIARCH](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/27/barbara-bush-blamed-trump-heart-attack-leaving-gop-the-matriarch/3270187002/), from the chapter about her (strong) views about President Trump.
