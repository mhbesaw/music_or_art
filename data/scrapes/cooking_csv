The first dish is Puteta Chap, a fried disk of mashed potato stuffed with ground beef and spices.

The next dish is shorbat hamudh shalgham, cream of turnip and chard stew with Mosul kubba (ground rice and beef dough stuffed with more spiced beef)

After that is zarda w'haleeb, milky saffron rice pudding with rosewater, topped with cinnamon

Then we have tabbouleh, the ubiquitous middle eastern dish of bulghur wheat, parsley, lemon juice, olive oil, and chopped tomatoes

Next, margat bamia, which is lamb stew with okra, with a side of home-made parsnip pickles, cabbage dolma, and hummus, as well as rice and labneh

Then we have more home-made hummus, topped with sumac and olive oil

The next dish is something called a ""tashreeb"" (soaked bread), which is torn home-made bread in a tangy tomato and tamarind sauce, with labneh

Finally, the home-made bread, called khubz tanoor.

All of these recipes are from the spectacular Nawal Nasrallah - I have her cookbook ""Delights from the Garden of Eden"" which I cannot recommend enough.

3,"Today, I wanted to share with you how to make an awesome Cantonese fried pork rib dish, tangerine peel pork ribs.

This is probably not a dish that most of you are aware of, likely for good reason. In the age of Instagram, I doubt it’d make any sense for a restaurant to put on their menu. Why? Well… it *looks* pretty damn unassuming.  It’s served dry, and visually, seems like it’s nothing special. It’s not smothered in sauce, there’s no eye-catching colors, and definitely can’t be served in a taco or gua bao.  

But taste-wise? Christ. It’s good. As you read on, you might end up thinking to yourself “hmm… this seems like a lot of work, I think I’ll pass”. I’d implore you to reconsider. I usually don’t really talk up the dishes in these posts, but honestly, this would easily make a top five list of the tastiest things we’ve shared here.

Now, just in case you *are* familiar with the dish, know that we were aiming to recreate a specific rendition from a now-defunct restaurant in Guangzhou called *Lei Wah*. They were an old school sort of joint that was famous for their Tangerine Pork Ribs – and like many awesome old restaurants, sadly eventually washed away by the relentless rising tide of modernism. It definitely took a good bit of trial and error to get to a place where we felt the ribs were comparable.

[Video is here if you’d like a visual to follow along](https://youtu.be/kLAa4wr0cpc).

**Ingredients:**

1.	*Spare ribs, St. Louis-style cut (排骨), 300g.* Cleaved across the bone into ~2cm pieces. The actual cut of ribs that we’re using is the center portion of the spare rib, with the breast bone and extra skirt meat sliced off. Conveniently, the exact same cut exists in the US, where it’s known as ‘St. Louis-style spareribs’. As an aside, 300g of pork ribs isn’t a lot, so if you wanna double/triple/quadruple the recipe… go for it. You’d just have to deep fry in batches in that case.

2.	*Jianshui alkaline water, a.k.a. Kan Sui (碱水) -or- baked baking soda, 1 tsp.* So we’ll actually be using the same method to prep the ribs as you’d use to make Dim Sum-style steamed ribs. This means… alkaline water. Unfortunately, baking soda isn’t a good sub, as it’s nowhere near basic enough. However, if you bake the baking soda for one hour at 150C, the sodium bicarbonate will change to sodium carbonate, which’s much more alkaline. Sodium carbonate works well here too, so feel free to go that route if you like.

3.	*Ingredients for the marinade/brine: ~3 cups water, 5g dried and aged tangerine peel (陈皮), 15g licorice root (甘草), eight whole cloves (丁香), one dried bay leaf (香叶), 5 tbsp sugar, 1 tbsp salt, optional sprinkle of MSG (味精), 1 tsp rice wine (米酒).* So a couple things. First off, make sure that you prep that dried and aged tangerine peel – we’ll talk about it more in the process below, but don’t forget. An unprepped dried tangerine peel can make for a bitter dish. Second, I know that this could probably be conceptualized as something closer to a brine than a marinade – in researching this dish, we stumbled on this approach of marinating the ribs which was (1) new to us and (2) seemed to get us closer to Lei Wah’s ribs. We’ll be keeping an eye out for other stuff that uses this sort of marinade. Lastly, for this rice wine we’re using plain ‘mijiu’, not Shaoxing. If you can’t find Chinese mijiu, sake would be a pretty direct sub… but feel free to use Shaoxing if that’s more convenient.     

4.	*Flour (面粉), ~3 tbsp.* For coating the ribs before deep frying.

5.	*Dried tangerine peel candy (九制陈皮), ground into a coarse powder; ½ tbsp of powder.* So using some mass produced candy might feel weird in a dish like this, but this is an ingredient that we *know* Lei Wah used. We’ll toss the ribs with it at the very end. The marinade flavors the meat, this stuff’ll give it a obvious tangerine peel kick.

6.	*Salt, ~1/8 tsp.* To season at the very end along with the tangerine peel powder.

**Process:**

1.	*Slice the ribs into 2 cm pieces.* If you’re cutting the spare ribs yourself, first get it into a St. Louis cut. Then slice out each rib, firmly hold the end, and cleave into ~2 cm pieces. Obviously, no need to do that yourself if you have a butcher that’ll do it for you.

2.	*Add the alkaline water to the ribs together with enough water to cover. Soak for ~30 minutes.* This will extract the myoglobin from the pork, lending a very pale color to the ribs. We opted for this method because it not only helped to tenderize the ribs, but also seemed to allow the marinade to seem into the ribs more. Why that could be is anyone’s guess, we could also be crazy I suppose.

3.	*As the ribs are soaking, prep the dried and aged tangerine peel: soak in hot boiled water for 20 minutes, then use a knife to scratch off the bitter with pith.* So for tangerine peel, a hot water soak is actually preferred as it’ll help remove some of the bitterness. One it’s pliable, about about twenty minutes, scratch off the pith (i.e. the white ‘interior’ portion of the peel) with a paring knife. Really go at it – it *is* annoying, but you don’t want that bitter pith to flavor the dish. 

4.	*Grind the tangerine peel candy into a coarse powder.* We used our coffee grinder. Try not to make the powder too fine – it should be roughly the same consistency as cracked black pepper.
5.	*Rinse the pork under running water for 5 minutes, stirring continuously, until the water runs clear.* Seems to help extract any remaining myoglobin if you stir a bit in one direction, then stir backwards. One the water runs clear, drain it out. Note that this is basically the same as the Dim Sum rib method, only less obsessive (there we did this process for 12-15 minutes).

6.	*Dry the ribs in a salad spinner.* We’ve found that this is the best way to dry the ribs, while also getting out any remaining myoglobin water. Set aside.

7.	*Make the marinade/brine: to the three cups of water, toss in the spices and bring up to a boil.* I.e. add the dried and aged tangerine peel, the licorice root, the clove, and the bay leaf. 

8.	*Once it’s at a boil, lower it to a simmer and let it simmer uncovered for ~20 minutes.* Or until it’s reduced by about one third.

9.	*Add in the sugar, the salt, the wine, and the MSG and shut off the heat. Mix and allow to get down to room temperature.* Obviously don’t want to add the ribs when this’s still hot. You could toss in one ice cube if you like in order to accelerate the process.

10.	*Add the pork to the marinade/brine, soak for at least three hours.* We haven’t really found an upper limit here, but given that there’s alcohol in there, I’m sure there is one. 

11.	*Transfer the ribs over to a bowl, and coat with the flour.* When transferring, you don’t need to be too paranoid drying them or anything… the small bit of marinade will also help to flavor the coating.

12.	*Heat up some oil (~3 cups if using a round bottomed wok) up til 180C, then add in the ribs. Deep fry for ~4 minutes at 145C.* Add the ribs one by one – this will lower the temperature, which’s fine because we’re aiming to fry at 145. Once the ribs are lightly golden brown, about four minutes, take them out.

13.	*Do a second fry at 195C for 20 seconds.* Real quick to crisp them right up.  Transfer over to a paper towel lined plate.

14.	*Pat out any excess oil, then sprinkle in the tangerine peel candy powder and the salt. Toss to coat.* Feel free to adjust the tangerine peel candy powder and salt to taste. I prefer slightly less powder than Steph does.

15.	*Optionally garnish with a totally inauthentic twist of orange.* You know, if you’re making YouTube thumbnails or something.

One burn treatment later, the chicken was fried to perfection and turned out to be a success. 


What’s your story of something that should have been considered a cooking failure but actually turned out great? Made fried chicken. Ended up with 2nd degree oil burns all up my forearm. Totally worth the taste though!"
19,"I just finished cooking dinner tonight, which ended up being... Something. I had chicken thighs and spinach that I'd bought to make salad, but I didn't want a salad so I cooked the spinach down in onions and butter, marinated the chicken, and cooked it all together. 

It tastes fine, but there's absolutely zero visual appeal and I'd be embarrassed serving this to anyone but myself (luckily my fiancee is at work). 

I've gotten to a point where I feel OK about my technical skills in cooking, but the creativity, side dishes to make a real meal, and presentation are absolutely lacking. I'm useless if not following a recipe, most meals just get served in a bowl, and I never do any sort of side.

20,"So I thought I'd take an [easy recipe](https://www.budgetbytes.com/easy-sesame-chicken/) for meal prep. I don't cook much (clearly), but when I do, I try to keep it simple, I usually succeed and never have a disaster. This was as close as I got to a disaster, but still totally edible and tasty. Having said that, I'd like to learn from the fail.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite the warnings in the recipe:

&gt;""Then, carefully flip the chicken, breaking up the pieces into smaller clumps as you flip... Stir the chicken as little as possible to avoid breaking the egg coating from the surface of the chicken.""

&amp;#x200B;

There were two problems:

1. Didn't sizzle, more like a casserole.
2. Most of the coating nowhere near to sticking to the chicken, hence was like having bits of scrambled egg in amongst the chicken.

&amp;#x200B;

NB I'm busy so I meal-prep once a week. Therefore I took 2.5 times the quantity of food (1.2kg diced chicken thighs and coating!), and stuck it all in the wok at once.  The wok seemed hot before but after slopping that lot in, it took a few minutes to get going. Immediate fail. I soldiered on, and after something like ten minutes (I didn't measure), the bottom looked cooked enough to turn. Except it wasn't just a matter of turning, I had like two layers in there. After something like 25 minutes in there, everything was cooked enough to add the sauce,  simmer, and reduce. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think I made two main mistakes:

1. Too much in the wok at one time, I should have cooked in batches.
2. Wok not hot enough (I once had a wok get super-fierce and didn't feel in control, although perhaps woks are meant to get super-fierce...).

&amp;#x200B;

I could also perhaps have cut the chunks a bit smaller.

&amp;#x200B;

Does this sound reasonable as an assessment of what might have gone wrong, or are there other things I might have missed? It could also be that this sort of dish just isn't suitable (for me) to do meal prep because of the batching.

Like, eye-watering hot. And Egg curry fits the bill perfectly. So here goes a recipe for Anda(egg) curry for two people:

Ingredients:
• 4 eggs boiled and peeled and cut into half
• 2 tbsp oil
• 1tsp cumin seeds
• 1 inch stick of cinnamon
• 3-4 cloves
• 2-3 green cardamom pods
• 2 green chillies, slit lengthwise (optional to deseed them)

• 1 large tomato, ground to a paste
• 1.5 tsp ginger garlic paste
• 1.5 tsp turmeric powder
• 3 tsp red chilli powder ( more or less depending on your taste)
• 2 tsp coriander powder
• 2 tsp garam masala powder
• 0.5 tsp kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves optional)
• salt to taste
• 0.5 tsp sugar
• 1-2 cups water
• cilantro

Method :
1. This is a totally optional step after you boil and peel the eggs. Take 1 tsp of oil in a pan and add a pinch of turmeric powder. Heat it on low flame and add the boiled eggs. Fry the eggs for 2 minutes and keep aside to cool after which cut them into half.

2. Heat 2tbsp of oil in a wok on medium flame.
3. Add cumin seeds. Once they start to crackle, add the cloves, cardamom and cinnamon. Stir till fragrant.
4. Add the onion paste and saute for 2 to 3 minutes till golden brown. Lower the flame and add ginger garlic paste. (Adding the GG paste on med or high flame burns it and removes the fragrance and flavour of both). Saute for a minute.
5. Add the tomato paste and increase the flame to a medium low. Add the sugar at this stage to fasten the cooking of the pastes. Cover and let cook for 5 minutes or till the paste leaves oil from the sides and starts moving as one lump.
6. Add dry spices: turmeric, chilli and coriander powder. Stir for 2 minutes. Lower the flame, cover the wok and let the flavours infuse into the paste for another 2-3 minutes. It should become heavily fragrant by now.
7. Depending on how thick you want the curry, add water. I added around 1.5 cups of water. Add salt to taste.
8. Increase the flame to high and bring the curry to a boil. Let it boil for around a minute or so.
9. Lower the flame and add the eggs to the curry. Let the curry simmer on low flame for around 5 minutes. The oil must float on top of the curry by now.
10. Add the garam masala, kasuri methi and the slit green chillies. Mix into the curry and simmer for 2 minutes.
11. Switch the flame off and let it rest for 2 minutes.

26,"Hey r/cooking,

&amp;#x200B;

As a line cook, one of my more recent daily prep items is to bake a vanilla chiffon cake before service every day. It usually turns out tasting good, but the texture faces one persistent issue: sugary chunks of separated egg yolk in the final product. These are usually small enough to be negligible, but they aren't ideal.

&amp;#x200B;

I pretty much was never shown how to make the cake all the way through; Like most recipes at this place, I was handed a list of ingredients, shown some basic technique, and told to make it good. Recently the chef has noticed all my cakes come out with those small bits interfering with the texture, and he showed me the recipe all the way through. His cake came out with a smooth texture, and he showed me how his technique differs from mine. I can probably replicate what he did and all will be well...

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, I still decided to do some independent research on chiffon cakes, and to my (complete lack of) surprise I can't find a chiffon cake recipe that resembles ours at all, nor can I find any links where anyone talks about troubleshooting chunks in a chiffon cake. Heres some of what I think are abnormalities. 

&amp;#x200B;

First: We start by making a mayonnaise with egg yolks, lemon juice, salt, vanilla, and olive oil. I can't find any recipes that include emulsifying the eggs and oil in this way. I am not sure why this is done at all, and it seems like other chiffon cake recipes I've found turn out fine (better even) without slowly pouring the oil into the egg yolks to make a mayo. I am not sure if this is the cause of the issue with chunks, but I have noticed that the chunks seem to have to do with the mayo being overworked and separating. I wonder if just mixing the oil and eggs all at once would prevent the mayo from overworking. 

&amp;#x200B;

Second: We whip the eggs to soft peaks/meringue with cream of tartar and ALL the sugar in the recipe. The biggest difference that stuck out to me with this one is that the sugar typically seemed to be split up between the egg whites and the other dry ingredients in other recipes. Also, we add the sugar to the egg whites at the beginning of whipping. I accidentally added it at the end once, and ended up with a meringue that much more closely resembles what I'm seeing in other chiffon cake recipes.

&amp;#x200B;

Third: We very slowly whisk in the flour in order to make sure it is fully incorporated. In my opinion, it seems like this is the step causing the issue. By the time I've added the flour in three or four parts, the mayo has become overworked and the egg yolks start to separate. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fourth: Least important to my question, but we grease our cake pan. I have found chiffon cake recipes explicitly saying not to do this. Probably inconsequential. 

&amp;#x200B;

What gives? I am planning on just following my chef's technique, but to me it seems like there might also be an issue in the recipe to begin with. I can provide the actual ingredient amounts if necessary. I just want to find out why these stupid chunks are forming and why this doesn't seem to be an issue discussed anywhere else.

1. Hard plastic, rectangle, smaller than a sheet of paper, with a grid of rubbery circles for non slip.  Used for non-raw meat.
2. Same as #1, but a different color.  Used for raw meat.
3. ""Preserve"" brand recycled plastic cutting board, 10"" by 8"",  used for foods I intend to eat raw (fruit, veggies, sandwiches, cheese, etc.)

I'd like to replace the first two because the surfaces on those have become so scratched up that I'm having a hard time keeping them clean and not stained. Cutting fish? Be prepared for gray marks from the skin. Carrots? I hope you like a yellowed color to your plastic! Mushrooms=Brown blob stains everywhere. I think I've had the boards maybe 10-12 years old by now!

Well now that I'm thinking about it, I actually have 5 boards... There are 2 bamboo boards that I still have that I stopped using. I didn't like how the bamboo seemed to splinter, so now I only use those for pizza night since one of them is so much bigger (approx 14"" x 20"" ) or if I run out of clean cutting boards.

Anyway, I'd love to hear about your cutting boards situation and your likes and dislikes! Thanks everyone!

[Fluffy souffle pancakes](https://www.chopstickchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SOUFFLE-PANCAKE-UPDATE-6.jpg) are pretty simple. Egg whites whipped to fluffy perfection and mixed into a batter of egg yolks with flour and milk! But it a little bit labor intensive and takes quite a lot of patience. You hardly find these in the United States or Europe, but who knows... maybe I'll open a pancake place and make it popular.

This makes about three tall fluffy pancakes that look like sunlit clouds full of joy and dopamine.

**INGREDIENTS**

2 large eggs

1 ½ Tbsp whole milk \[22 g\]

¼ tsp vanilla extract or paste

¼ cup [**cake flour**](https://bakingamoment.com/why-use-cake-flour/) \[30-33 g\]

½ tsp baking powder \[2 g\]

2 Tbsp sugar \[25 g\]

1 Tbsp neutral flavor oil or nonstick pan spray \[vegetable, canola, etc\]

2 Tbsp water \[for steaming\]

***Fresh Whipped Cream \[optional\]***

½ cup Heavy \[whipping\] cream \[120 ml\]

1 Tbsp sugar (20 g)

***Toppings***

1 Tbsp confectioners’ sugar/powder sugar

Fresh berries \[Whatever is in season; strawberries are the go to, but its up to you\]

Maple syrup \[The real stuff, not that processed fructose fake crap! Going through all this effort means quality assurances need to be made!\]

Equipment:

A large non-stick frying pan \[large enough to cook 3 '2-3in' pancakes at the same time\] with a lid.

A whisk \[manual, electric, or a kitchenaid with whisk attachment if you're particularly lucky\]

The usual assortment of bowls, spoon-based measurements, etc.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

Preheat the frying pan on the lowest setting and rub a little bit of oil onto the surface; do not add too much oil, you need just enough to create a thin film.

Separate egg whites and egg yolks into two different bowls. Put the bowl with egg whites in the freezer for 15 minutes.

Add milk and vanilla to the egg yolks and whisk until thick and frothy.

Sift the cake flour and baking powder into the bowl of egg yolk and milk.  Whisk to combine thoroughly, but do not over mix, just until the lumps are gone. If you have sifted, this should not be an issue.

After 15 minutes, take out the bowl with egg whites from the freezer. The egg whites should be somewhat frozen. Start your exercise regiment by start beating egg whites manually if you're hardcore.

When the egg whites turn frothy and pale white, gradually add in sugar.

The egg whites should become glossy and firm over time. Occasionally, stop beating and lift up the whisk. If the egg whites stand right up with stiff peaks slightly bending over like the world's whitest chocolate kiss, it is done.

It is time you mix everything together in holy matrimony.

Add a third of the fluffy clouds into the egg yolk mixture and whisk together. For this stage, you don't have to be gentle, but you shouldn't beat the crap out of it.

Add the remaining egg whites and now carefully and gently incorporate until there are no more whites.

Now, it is time to cook.

The rule of thumb is 4 scoops of batter per pancake. Use a large spoon or a small serving spoon. Each scoop should be about two to three tablespoons in total. Start with two scoops per pancake and as they settle down, add an additional scoop.

Add a tablespoon of water and cover to let steam for two minutes.

Take off the lid and add your fourth and final scoop. Cover and steam for another four minutes.

Take lid off and flip for an amazing golden brown top! Add the last tablespoon of water and cover with lid to steam for another four minutes.

Finally, at long last, take the lid off for last time and put these fluffy tall pancakes onto a plate. Top as you wish and dig in.

**TIPS**

***Why cake flour?***

Because cake flour as so little gluten in it, it is considered extremely light and thus perfect for rising; it is easier to work with for a souffle-style pancake and is more forgiving than standard All Purpose or \[heaven forbid\] bread flour.

***Can I use other types of flour?***

Absolutely! I will note that certain types of flours don't really interact the same way as wheat-based ones. Almond or coconut should be fine as substitutes, though the lack of gluten *might* affect the consistency of the batter.

***Can I use instant pancake mix?***

For all those with instant style mixes, do not despair! You can still achieve cloudy deliciousness! Just replace the dry ingredients with the standard instant mix. It may not rise nearly as well and might be a touch tougher, but it'll still work!

***Why put the egg whites in the freezer?***

Egg whites will retain and incorporate more air if they're very cold; if too warm, the whites will not firm up and they'll just droop and melt. Doing it this way allows the egg whites to be whipped without cream of tartar, so that's an extra step gone! This method also allows for the whites to remain strong against the heat and rise fluffier and taller.

***Cook the pancakes low, covered, and slow.***

Unlike most pancakes, these ones are thicker and fluffier. Cooking them on high heat will make it look like it's done... but the insides will be raw and not very pleasant to eat. Lock in the heat and moisture by closing it up with a lid. Deliciousness takes time and patience. Don't worry, it'll all be worth it!

***Can I whip the egg whites ahead of time?***

You can actually! A little bit of air will seep out, but they will be perfectly usable for at least a day... two if you really want to press your luck. Once you finish whipping to stiff peaks, put it all in airtight container, put saran wrap on it \[press it directly against the whites as you would a fresh custard\], close, and  keep it in the coldest part of your fridge.Note: **Fridge**, *not* the freezer.

If you have any other questions, by all means, ask and I will answer the best I can.

Add a third of the fluffy clouds into the egg yolk mixture and whisk together. For this stage, you don't have to be gentle, but you shouldn't beat the crap out of it.

Add the remaining egg whites and now carefully and gently incorporate until there are no more whites.

Now, it is time to cook.

The rule of thumb is 4 scoops of batter per pancake. Use a large spoon or a small serving spoon. Each scoop should be about two to three tablespoons in total. Start with two scoops per pancake and as they settle down, add an additional scoop.

Add a tablespoon of water and cover to let steam for two minutes.

Take off the lid and add your fourth and final scoop. Cover and steam for another four minutes.

Take lid off and flip for an amazing golden brown top! Add the last tablespoon of water and cover with lid to steam for another four minutes.

Finally, at long last, take the lid off for last time and put these fluffy tall pancakes onto a plate. Top as you wish and dig in.

**TIPS**

***Why cake flour?***

Because cake flour as so little gluten in it, it is considered extremely light and thus perfect for rising; it is easier to work with for a souffle-style pancake and is more forgiving than standard All Purpose or \[heaven forbid\] bread flour.

***Can I use other types of flour?***

Absolutely! I will note that certain types of flours don't really interact the same way as wheat-based ones. Almond or coconut should be fine as substitutes, though the lack of gluten *might* affect the consistency of the batter.

***Can I use instant pancake mix?***

For all those with instant style mixes, do not despair! You can still achieve cloudy deliciousness! Just replace the dry ingredients with the standard instant mix. It may not rise nearly as well and might be a touch tougher, but it'll still work!

***Why put the egg whites in the freezer?***

Egg whites will retain and incorporate more air if they're very cold; if too warm, the whites will not firm up and they'll just droop and melt. Doing it this way allows the egg whites to be whipped without cream of tartar, so that's an extra step gone! This method also allows for the whites to remain strong against the heat and rise fluffier and taller.

***Cook the pancakes low, covered, and slow.***

Unlike most pancakes, these ones are thicker and fluffier. Cooking them on high heat will make it look like it's done... but the insides will be raw and not very pleasant to eat. Lock in the heat and moisture by closing it up with a lid. Deliciousness takes time and patience. Don't worry, it'll all be worth it!

***Can I whip the egg whites ahead of time?***

You can actually! A little bit of air will seep out, but they will be perfectly usable for at least a day... two if you really want to press your luck. Once you finish whipping to stiff peaks, put it all in airtight container, put saran wrap on it \[press it directly against the whites as you would a fresh custard\], close, and  keep it in the coldest part of your fridge.Note: **Fridge**, *not* the freezer.

If you have any other questions, by all means, ask and I will answer the best I can.

123,"To preface, I make fresh bread once of twice a week. I keep a 6 quart bucket in my fridge, with a batch of King Arthur's No Knead White Bread dough on the ready. I have also made White Mountain breads, Italian loaves, focaccia, dinner rolls, challah (awhile back), and a few others- but white bread dough is versatile and delicious, makes for a satisfying loaf or boulé on pretty short notice. 

Last night, my mom asked ME, her 20 year old, if I could show her how it is done. I told her I had enough dough in the fridge for a loaf, and showed her how to shape it and prove it to bake. We floured the bannetone and let the dough rise for 90 minutes, and preheated a pizza peel along with a loaf pan (to create steam) to 450. Than, I showed her how to release the dough on to the hot pizza peel. She really wanted to do a fancy score design. She made a weird sort of zebra pattern, I went with it haha. The dough definitely deflated from handling it for too long, but I wanted her to get to experiment with the pattern. 

She was nervous to pour the hot steaming water in the screaming hot oven, but I told her that steam creates a thick and crisp crust, and told her not to open the oven to peak on it until the timer was up. 

She was pretty excited. She did open the oven a few times, and after 25 minutes decided the loaf was complete. I showed her that two ways to test doneness are by listening for the hollow sound or checking the internal temp. She said ""it looked done to her"" although I would've definitely let it get a bit darker. 

She was so excited to try her first bread. I warned that if she cut it too early, there'd likely be some raw dough in there or excess moisture since bread tends to ""finish up"" as it cools. Well she was excited, and after about 10 minutes she cracked in to the loaf. There was some raw dough, but we rubbed with butter and fleur de sel, and she took the first bite of bread she had helped create. She was so excited. Half the loaf is gone today. 

I offered to teach her to make the dough but she said ""nah, maybe some other time. baking it was so technical, i respect it a lot. i can see why you do this so often."" 

So last night I got to teach my mom a little more about the baking I do. It was really cool. Thanks for reading.

130,"Okay, I asked the question, and got every answer from ""Don't use volume, use weight"" (Which was the *point* of the question...) to ""Google it"" (which gives multiple answers... hence the question that says there are conflicting answers online...) to ""120 grams, 125 grams, 140 grams, 142 grams"" to ""Why don't you weigh it and tell us.""

Honest to God, I just thought that a collection of this many redditors in a cooking sub would either know the answer, or at least be able to say ""it varies / it doesn't matter / -ish.""  I wasn't looking to piss off anybody or open myself up to being lambasted for trying to find an answer.

But, as was suggested, maybe I should just tell everyone what I came up with.

First off:  This is an **absurd** amount of work to put in to this.  I am fully aware of this.  The methods I used are more suitable for aerospace engine components than they are for Yorkshire puddings.  I also took a few liberties with the methods to adopt them for my kitchen.  But at the end, I'm pretty confident in this one data point.  Which does not make it a gospel answer, it's just what I got this one time.  So please don't remind me that the answer varies, I know that.  I just wanted to see, and felt like sharing.  And I know the terms I used won't work if you are studying for a test in statistics, I wanted to give the results in a more ""everybody-friendly"" format.

Short version… which is still a little long:

First step was to confirm the accuracy of the scale.  With most measuring instruments, this is done by performing a GR&amp;R study (Gage Repeatability and Reproducibility, and yes, that is how the word Gauge is spelled.)  This is a statistical test that measures the device’s repeatability at measuring a consistent object, and also measures any variation that comes from different people using the gage.  The results show the scale is reliable for measurements accurate to slightly over ±6 grams.  (That is, statistically the scale repeats within ±.65 grams over 100 trials.)  It also showed that the top left corner of my scale measures almost 2/3 of a gram heavier (on average) than the bottom right.

Secondly, I wanted to remove any huge differences that would come about from inconsistent material, specifically ‘packed’ vs ‘sifted.’  Again – this is an attempt to find a good value for an unspecified “3 cups flour” instruction that does not specify 'sifted' or 'packed.'.  So I did my usual routine… We keep our flour in a large canister in our kitchen.  I usually pour about half of it into a large mixing bowl and then fill my measuring cup from there.  It isn’t too packed that way.  After each measurement, the flour went back into the bowl.  The final results show me that this is pretty consistent.

The third step was to confirm my own ability to collect a consistent amount TO weigh.  This was done using a metric called “Cpk,” which is an index indicating the ability of a process to repeat within a specified tolerance.  Generally a process must have a minimum index of 1.33 (which translates into appx 63 or fewer bad parts per million) although many industries require a 1.67 minimum (&lt;4 bad parts per million.)  This is generally used for mass-produced critical components… transmission parts, aircraft engines, like that.  It is way more than that as well, but it seems like it might be a quick and easy method to confirm how accurately I can come up with a cup of flour.  Worth noting – this process is mostly used to see how capable a process is at hitting a desired target and tolerance.  However, as I do not *know* the target (grams per cup) then I had to back figure to answer the question “Given this data set, what target and tolerance would this be capable of?”   

As it turns out, I am able to make a 139-gram cup of flour within 6.8 grams pretty reliably with a 1.33 Cpk (at 34% relative humidity according to the weather station in my kitchen.)

However… I also wanted to confirm the accuracy of my measuring cup.  So, I filled the scoop with filtered water 10 times, and weighed it each time.  I came up with an average weight of 254 ± 2 grams.  1 cup should weigh 236.59 grams, which means my measuring cup has more volume than it should.  I did not know that until this weekend!

Correcting for this extra volume, and using the 139-gram average that I achieved, I can subtract the extra weight from the measurements, for a grand total of:

128.8804 grams per cup (plus or minus 2 teaspoons) of Pillsbury All-Purpose Flour.  Approximately.

Once he stopped that and began eating homecooked foods I was preparing (we're financially pinched atm, so it was a little protein, veggies, and more starches), he started losing a lot of weight. Ensue panic.

What meals can I make that are cheap and healthy that can help him gain weight? I see him looking at himself in the mirror at his hip bones starting to jut out with such a worried look on his face, it makes me really worried.What are some good meals that help you gain weight?"

143,"Hello, so I tend to make marinara sauce in large batches to keep all the time. It is a staple in many of my recipes, and takes about 4 hours to make so I prefer to make it ahead. 

I have made very good meatballs in the past. I use all ground beef, and flavor them with lots of herbs, parmigiano, etc. I typically sear them in a pan to caramelize the outside and cook them through, than just serve with warm sauce over top (or pour some sauce over and melt some cheese as well). However, I think a much more tender meatball would result if after the initial sear, I cooked the meatballs more gently by simmering them in sauce. I see a lot of recipes for which the sauce recipe is built around the meatballs, where the meatballs simmer for hours, but since my sauce is already cooked, I don't want to further reduce it for hours and hours. 

If after searing, I poured a good amount of sauce over the meatballs in a pot, and simmered it for say 1-2 hours (thinning as necessary with some water, maybe?) would this give me a good result?

They were quite a hit too!  Here's the details:


For the rub, I used a tablespoon each of garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder and paprika, 2-3 tablespoons of kosher salt and about 10 twists of the pepper mill.


Dry a 4-5 pound pork loin roast, and coat the entire thing with the rub.  Pop it into the slow cooker with a half cup of chicken stock, half cup of apple cider vinegar and a half a head of peeled garlic for 4 hours on high.  Shred in the cooker with a pair of forks when it's done, keeping all of the juices in the pot.


For the pico, I used 6 roma tomatoes, one medium yellow onion, 4 large jalapenos, half a bunch of cilantro, a pinch of salt and the juice from one lime.  I put the veggies through the food processor separately, and drained the tomatoes in a sieve for about a half hour(with the salt mixed in).  Then, I combined the onions, cilantro, lime juice and tomatoes in one container and kept the jalapenos in another so folks at the potluck could decide their own heat level.

175,"Hey! So the weather is hot this week and I haven't had some good fried chicken in forever, so gonna make some buttermilk fried chicken this week. Choosing sides is the hardest part. 

Since we're probably going to be eating outside, I'm gonna keep appetizers simple and just do a simple starter of cheese, crackers, and fruit. Thinking of cheddar, brie, grapes, some pretzels. Nothing over the top. I don't think a cold dip is necessary. 

For bread I'm going to make some buttermilk biscuits. 

Main Dish is gonna be some fried chicken. Choosing sides is the hardest part. 

Mashed potatoes are a must. I make a really good one and everyone is always happy with it. 

Also for a vegetable, I was thinking corn? I do it street corn style, with garlic and parmesan. My mom's pretty much asking for it on the daily, I like it as well. Just doesn't feel super green, but that's okay. 

I definitely want at least one cold thing though- something salad-esque at least. I made coleslaw a couple of days ago and am in the mood for something else. I was thinking potato salad but I'm already doing potatoes. Would macaroni salad be a viable option? Do you think this would go down well?

So the menu would be - 

Starter - Cheese and Fruit

Bread - Buttermilk Biscuits

Entreé - Southern Fried Chicken served with choice of Hot Honey, Barbecue, or Buffalo Sauxe

Sides - Deli Style Macaroni Salad
Creamy Garlic Mashed Potatoes
Grilled Corn on the Cob

[https://imgur.com/a/252Yeon](https://imgur.com/a/252Yeon)

&amp;#x200B;

My process:

* Put bones (leg bones and also meaty beef bones) in the pot
* boil on high temp for about 30-60 min in order to get the foam out, remove foam continuously
* reduce to a simmer, add vegetables and seasoning:
* Celery Roots and Greens, Carrots, Parsley Roots, Onions, Some dried tomatoes, vinegar, pepper, parsley, bay leaves, some other spices
* After about 12h of cooking I increased the temp to a rolling boil, turned off the stove and went to sleep
* In the morning I started again, 10 min rolling boil, then simmer for another 12h
* After that I put the soup through a sieve and bottled it

I do not roast the bones nor the onions or anything really. Still, the color is never clear.

Is it just a smorgasbord of random ingredients?

I included the recipe below in case anyone was interested. When I make it, it's usually power cooking for myself for the week (serves about 5-6 servings) and costs a little less than $30 (way less if you already had the wine). 

&amp;#x200B;

Ingredients: Pasta, chicken, mushrooms, onion, sundried/cherry tomatoes, half&amp;half/chicken stock/WHITE WINE, spinach or argula, basil/parsley, butter, garlic

&amp;#x200B;

I use a 5 qt sautee pan for all this:

Cook 3-4 CHICKEN THIGHS (or BREASTS) with a light layer of oil just so the chicken doesn't stick then take them out and place in a bowl on the side

Also on the side, boil water &amp; 1/2 cook or 3/4 cook \~1LB of PASTA (of your choice) and strain when they are not fully done as they will finish cooking later

Put 1-1.5LB of MUSHROOMS &amp; 2 tbsp of BUTTER(or similar substitute) in same pan and sauteeee

Add 1 large ONION to the pan then 5-6 GARLIC cloves chopped and sautee for a while

Add 1-1.5 cup of white wine of you choice (I usually use some $10 bottle) let this cook for a bit

Add however many SUNDRIED TOMATOS you want (I usually use alot because I like them)

Add 1-1.5cups of HALF/HALF(or heavy cream?), 3-4 cups of CHICKEN STOCK, and the PASTA/CHICKEN back in there. Make sure all the pasta/chicken is getting covered and soaking the sauce. 

Let this chill in the pan for a while and then add SPINACHorARUGULA (I usually use the amount of one of those big plastic boxes, I don't know the weight. Produce like that shrinks alot and adds a lot of heckin healthy flavor)

Add about 30oz chopped in half or whole CHERRY TOMATOS 

Last add BASIL and PARSLEY (I add alot of basil from my basil plants because you can never add too much basil)

FINALLY pour a glass of leftover white wine, throw some on a plate and ENJOY! Then box the leftovers in individual to-go's and enjoy lunch at work and then dinner when you come home. Quick note on heating at work: my office has a toaster oven so I throw the chicken in there to heat for a few minutes while I just microwave the pasta (I know its gross with the vegetables and all, but whatevs).

197,"I technically have two kitchens in my house. The main kitchen and what I call a 'spice kitchen' which is a smaller, self contained secondary kitchen adjacent to the main kitchen where I make my own spices and cook food that have strong odors and fragrances. They are sometimes referred to as 'wok kitchens' as well and sometimes are found in Indian and Chinese homes. As someone who loves cooking and does like to cook foods and is adventurous in my home cooking, having a spice kitchen that is well ventilated is a joy because I like to cook Asian and African foods and while the end product is delicious and lovely the cooking process for some of these foods can stink out my entire house and the strong smells and aroma can linger on for a while, which can become quite inpleasant.

Do any of you have something similar in your home?",Do Any of You Have a Separate 'Spice Kitchen' In Your Home?,Cooking,"I technically have two kitchens in my house. The main kitchen and what I call a 'spice kitchen' which is a smaller, self contained secondary kitchen adjacent to the main kitchen where I make my own spices and cook food that have strong odors and fragrances. They are sometimes referred to as 'wok kitchens' as well and sometimes are found in Indian and Chinese homes. As someone who loves cooking and does like to cook foods and is adventurous in my home cooking, having a spice kitchen that is well ventilated is a joy because I like to cook Asian and African foods and while the end product is delicious and lovely the cooking process for some of these foods can stink out my entire house and the strong smells and aroma can linger on for a while, which can become quite inpleasant.

207,"I was trying to make a vegan version of buttercream frosting without any margarine, shortening, or ""buttery sticks."" I couldn't find a recipe for that, so I decided to experiment and started with a vegan whipped cream recipe that calls for full fat coconut milk.

The whipped cream recipe goes like this:
Let can sit in the fridge so that the fat separates from the liquid. Pour out liquid, beat hardened coconut milk for a minute or so with powdered sugar and vanilla extract.

I didn't read the recipe completely before getting started, so I ended up beating my coconut milk much too long. Despite chilling my coconut milk and pouring out the separated liquid from the beginning, it separated again from overbeating. I squeezed the liquid out with cheesecloth, returned the fat to the mixing bowl, and beat it some more. It smoothed out to a perfect buttercream texture.

Did I simply finish the process of separation by squeezing out the excess liquid with cheesecloth, which is usually accomplished by chilling and pouring off the liquid *if* you don't have a dud can of coconut milk, or did I make coconut butter? 

If it's the former, I need to figure out what brands of coconut milk are better quality. If it's the latter, I'll buy coconut butter from now on to streamline the recipe.

253,"I like to make my own rather than buy at the store so I know what the ingredients are and to control the seasoning to my liking.  Mostly, I don't want to pay $4 or more for mystery meat with spices mixed in.  This recipe works with ground turkey, chicken, pork, and I suppose whatever ground meat you have to work with.  If you don't have the herbs and spices already the initial cost will be a bit more (roughly $10 total for three you may not have), but spread out over several batches and having them on hand for other recipes is worth it, IMO.  You can make patties or links, but I find patties make it easier to portion and get some good browning without overcooking with leaner meats.  A burger press makes quick work of the patties (cover both sides with cling film for easier cleanup).  I have not tried this recipe in casings.

For poultry, 85% and 93% lean are common in stores, and I've used both with good results.  If you don't know what 85% lean is (sometimes shows as 85/15, beef is often 80/20) it's the ratio of lean meat to fat content; the higher the first number or percentage, the leaner the grind.

I consider this to yield a mild to medium sausage in terms of spiciness.  You could halve the chipotle powder and add 1/8 teaspoon of smoked paprika to knock it down a bit, add more if you like a kick, or substitute smoked paprika if you just want the smoky flavor without the heat. 

&amp;#x200B;

1 teaspoon dried rubbed sage (ground is fine)

1 teaspoon Kosher salt (table salt or sea salt is fine)

1/2 teaspoon black pepper

1/4 teaspoon chipotle powder

1/8 teaspoon dried marjoram

1 lb ground turkey, chicken, or pork, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mix the herbs and spices together in a small bowl or glass.  You can mix everything together in a bowl if you'd like, but I prefer a flat surface covered in cling film or parchment.  Place the meat in a large bowl and flatten it against the inside, or spread out on your flat surface (don't go too crazy, a half inch thickness is plenty thin, use your judgment).  Coat the meat with the spice blend as evenly as you can, then folding the meat into itself until you no longer see streaks of seasoning as you fold it in.  I use my hands with nitrile gloves, but bare hands work, or a large spatula (wet your hands under the sink to minimize the mixture sticking to your hands).  Once you've incorporated the spice blend into the meat, use a spoon, your hands, or a portioning scoop to take 1.0-1.4oz (30-40g) of the mix (about the size of a ping pong ball, or I use a kitchen scale to stay consistent).  Roll the mixture in your hands into a ball and form into a patty or link.  Try to keep the size consistent for even cooking (1/4 inch thickness is ideal for a patty).  If you plan to freeze or refrigerate for later use, place parchment, wax paper, or cling film between the formed link or patty to keep them from sticking together.  Personally, I fold the parchment over the top.  To freeze, place a sheet pan in the freezer so it's nice and cold, then place the sausage in a ziploc bag on the pan.  It will keep for weeks frozen, and I would use within a few days if just refrigerated.

I like to put two patties on a piece of parchment, fold it over the top, and vacuum seal bags with two patties so I can grab one bag from the freezer the night before to thaw for the next morning.  If you don't have a vacuum sealer, the folded over parchment makes it easy to pull just a few patties from a large freezer bag without thawing the whole bag.

To cook straight from the refrigerator, place a skillet on the stove at medium-high heat.  It's hot enough when you can wet your finger, flick it in the pan, and hear/see the water sizzle.  Pour in a tablespoon of olive oil (or other cooking oil), let it warm for 20-30 seconds, and go in with the sausage.  With the 1/4 inch thickness you're looking at a minute and a half to two minutes each side, with an internal temperature of 165, minimum. My test from today's batch was roughly 1:45 per side and hit an internal temperature of 170 after coming off the heat.

&amp;#x200B;",Homemade breakfast sausage,Cooking,"I like to make my own rather than buy at the store so I know what the ingredients are and to control the seasoning to my liking.  Mostly, I don't want to pay $4 or more for mystery meat with spices mixed in.  This recipe works with ground turkey, chicken, pork, and I suppose whatever ground meat you have to work with.  If you don't have the herbs and spices already the initial cost will be a bit more (roughly $10 total for three you may not have), but spread out over several batches and having them on hand for other recipes is worth it, IMO.  You can make patties or links, but I find patties make it easier to portion and get some good browning without overcooking with leaner meats.  A burger press makes quick work of the patties (cover both sides with cling film for easier cleanup).  I have not tried this recipe in casings.

For poultry, 85% and 93% lean are common in stores, and I've used both with good results.  If you don't know what 85% lean is (sometimes shows as 85/15, beef is often 80/20) it's the ratio of lean meat to fat content; the higher the first number or percentage, the leaner the grind.

I consider this to yield a mild to medium sausage in terms of spiciness.  You could halve the chipotle powder and add 1/8 teaspoon of smoked paprika to knock it down a bit, add more if you like a kick, or substitute smoked paprika if you just want the smoky flavor without the heat. 

&amp;#x200B;

1 teaspoon dried rubbed sage (ground is fine)

1 teaspoon Kosher salt (table salt or sea salt is fine)

1/2 teaspoon black pepper

1/4 teaspoon chipotle powder

1/8 teaspoon dried marjoram

1 lb ground turkey, chicken, or pork, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mix the herbs and spices together in a small bowl or glass.  You can mix everything together in a bowl if you'd like, but I prefer a flat surface covered in cling film or parchment.  Place the meat in a large bowl and flatten it against the inside, or spread out on your flat surface (don't go too crazy, a half inch thickness is plenty thin, use your judgment).  Coat the meat with the spice blend as evenly as you can, then folding the meat into itself until you no longer see streaks of seasoning as you fold it in.  I use my hands with nitrile gloves, but bare hands work, or a large spatula (wet your hands under the sink to minimize the mixture sticking to your hands).  Once you've incorporated the spice blend into the meat, use a spoon, your hands, or a portioning scoop to take 1.0-1.4oz (30-40g) of the mix (about the size of a ping pong ball, or I use a kitchen scale to stay consistent).  Roll the mixture in your hands into a ball and form into a patty or link.  Try to keep the size consistent for even cooking (1/4 inch thickness is ideal for a patty).  If you plan to freeze or refrigerate for later use, place parchment, wax paper, or cling film between the formed link or patty to keep them from sticking together.  Personally, I fold the parchment over the top.  To freeze, place a sheet pan in the freezer so it's nice and cold, then place the sausage in a ziploc bag on the pan.  It will keep for weeks frozen, and I would use within a few days if just refrigerated.

I like to put two patties on a piece of parchment, fold it over the top, and vacuum seal bags with two patties so I can grab one bag from the freezer the night before to thaw for the next morning.  If you don't have a vacuum sealer, the folded over parchment makes it easy to pull just a few patties from a large freezer bag without thawing the whole bag.

To cook straight from the refrigerator, place a skillet on the stove at medium-high heat.  It's hot enough when you can wet your finger, flick it in the pan, and hear/see the water sizzle.  Pour in a tablespoon of olive oil (or other cooking oil), let it warm for 20-30 seconds, and go in with the sausage.  With the 1/4 inch thickness you're looking at a minute and a half to two minutes each side, with an internal temperature of 165, minimum. My test from today's batch was roughly 1:45 per side and hit an internal temperature of 170 after coming off the heat.

I wanted to make sure my friend didn’t have to worry about dinner for a couple nights, so I threw together a big pot of chicken noodle soup for her and her husband. Fortunately I’ve made this recipe a million times so I don’t have to worry about tasting obsessively to get it perfect. Only had to make one adjustment and I didn’t even have to eat any chicken. 

I wanted to share because old recipes like this always makes me nostalgic and feel good inside. I hope that this puts a smile on my friend’s face when I see her tonight.

261,"Hey guys, last night I had people over for dinner, and I think the food turned out really nicely. Every week I try to work on cooking techniques- mastering them, fine-tuning, etc. 

Thursday night I barbecued. Smoked some ribs and made the sides plus dessert. My goal was to get a decent smoke ring, super tender and moist ribs, and to time it properly. So I did that. 

Last night (Friday) I had people over for dinner and decided to make Italian. I had originally planned a menu of chicken parmesan, garlic bread, an antipasti platter, baked ziti. I ended up changing things up. 

I served -

Fresh Warm Bread (King Arthur recipe) with Garlic Infused Dipping Oil (and butter with Fleur de Sel, I'm a sucker for warm bread and butter). 

Tricolore Salad with Apple Cider Vinaigrette - really fresh, cool, and delicious. 

3 Cheeses - Bocconcini with Parma Prosciutto, Fromager D'aphinois Creme Brie, and Cambozola. I loved the bocconcini paired with the prosciutto. Magnificent. 

than, for salad I made a homemade caesar. Made the croutons a few days in advance using leftover bread I had baked, and used Chef John's method for garlic-parmesan breadcrumbs. I also made the dressing from scratch, which came out amazing. I mashed the anchovies by hand, was juicing the lemons, grating the parm. It really paid off when my neighbor texted me this morning and said ""Great foodie work. I especially love your homemade dressings, dips, and herb oils. They are excellent."" It's rare that you hear a comment about a salad dressing, you know?

The main meal ended up being Chicken Parmesan and Spaghetti with Marinara sauce. I ended up nixing the baked ziti because it is such a rich and delicious dish on it's own, and I had worked so hard on the marinara (4 hours- I made it last week and kept it in the freezer til yesterday) that I really wanted to appreciate the flavors. 

The chicken fried to a golden color without burning, and I ladled on some sauce, some freshly grated mozzarella, and a bit of parmesan. I seasoned the breadcrumbs as well with parmesan, fresh herbs, garlic. 

I also tried to present the plates nicely, I took some photos so I'd love some feedback on that. How do you all think I can continue improving? I think I'm getting better with food pairing choices and techniques. Thanks so much for all the help. This subreddit has been so beneficial to me so far.

 I am going to start by introducing my self then I will go into detail about what I am doing here   first I am Borf, and I am a computer tech  one of my passions is cooking  but I will be the first to admit that I am not very good at it, I spend a lot of time watching videos on you tube, I watch a lot of binging with Babish AND you suck at cooking  there are a bunch of videos I watch on you tube but these are kinda my two favorite. I am obsessed with Gordon Ramsey, and Julia Childs they are my personal hero's although I do not own any of miss Childs cook books I plan to get them soon   so that's a little back ground about me to kinda add context to this post   after watching the movie “Julie and Julia” I decided I too wanted to embark on a cooking adventure it seems like a great idea to try out new recipes things that I would not normally try out .   So I pooled all of my cook books admittedly I only have 5 of them  and 2 of them are really nerdy gimmick cook books. I compiled a list of the first 20 recipes from each of them and created a list of 100 recipes  all of them are ranging in difficulty there is the Hells kitchen cookbook in there with Gordon Ramsay recipes as well and I plan to cook my way through them starting this week and I figured I may as well share my experience with you all. As I cook them I will have my food scored by a person who is pretty much the most important person other than myself in my life (she is my “its complicated on face book”).  she is a VERY picky eater  we will call this the S score. The S score will always be brutal but fair.     
this first recipe is not on the list but is kind of a warm up London broil steaks and Peach cobbler (don't get used to the two recipes making so much sense ).  
steak Prep (my own idea): I bought some season from a place in Washington called pikes place its a steak seasoning I put both steaks in tin foil and covered them with a generous amount of olive oil  and the seasoning from pikes place on both sides then wrapped them up tightly and refrigerated over night, next night I let them warm up to room temperature before pan frying  starting with the fat side of the beef on the hot pan until the fat broke down and coated the pan with oil then I seared both sides of the steaks until they had an almost crisp edge on both sides  and put them in the over at 375 for  10 mins  when I cut them open as you can see they had a little more red than I was after probably should have put them in there for 15 mins but you live you learn   S score 5/10   complaints the seasoning I had did not have any real amounts of salt could have used a  lot of salt also the cuts I used where very tough cuts of meat probably would have been better with a better cut  but hey its my first go at this .  
Peach cobbler prep(tastes better from scratch website) : OK so this is seriously the most basic  peach cobbler I had 4 jars of canned peaches from a bumper crop out on Moab Utah a few years ago and they where getting brown so I figured it was time to use them up  following a recipe I found online. As far as the recipe goes I don't know if I should go into like real detail when the recipe belongs to someone else or not but trust me its just a basic recipe flour sugar cinnamon milk and an egg   S score  7/ 10 it was perfectly edible tasted sweet and the bread bits where nice and light and fluffy but it is very basic I think next time I try something like this I will do a crumble rather than something like a cobbler

306,"Morning all (if you’re close to my
Time zone!)

I’m thinking about making some roasted chicken thighs later today for a friend, and was looking for some opinions on whether I should brown them in a pan before. Considerations below

1.	I’m going stuff the thighs with breadcrumbs (+ lemon, thyme, garlic and onion)
2.	Should I fry before stuffing? Could imagine it gets messy, but there’s some loss of flexibility in the meat once browned
2.	I don’t have access to a skillet
3.	want to keep the thighs moist - how much should I reduce cooking time / balance pan vs. oven?

One of the reasons for wanting to is uneven browning in the oven. I often find that only the top surface gets crispy, with the bottom being smooth and slightly oily. Also don’t want the stuffing to dry out too much if I flip the stuffed thighs mid way.

tl;dr: I need to buy basically all new kitchen stuff. What do you recommend for my needs, cooking for up to 8 people, mostly from scratch, mostly Italian but also Mexican, Chinese, Indian, and American Southern? I'll list what I have. Advice is greatly appreciated.

We're moving to a new house, and our old housemate—the one who owns basically everything in the kitchen—is not moving with us. So, when the rest of us move, I'll need to replace basically *everything.*

I don't know what my budget is exactly yet, but I prefer to buy the best quality I can reasonably afford that is still considered ""workhorse"" and not ""for show."" I used to work in kitchens and I cook a lot from scratch for my household (4 adults + frequent guests and partners). Presentation and consistency are important to us, aside from taste, my family is from Emilia-Romagna in northern Italy and cheese, food, and wine are *VERY* important in my culture. However I am not remotely interested in spending $1000 on a Le Crueset set, I plan to go restaurant supply stores mostly unless you recommend something else. It's common for me to cook for 6-8 people though, so I don't want to buy the cheap stuff that won't work GREAT and hold up to a lot of use, either. I don't abuse my tools but I do use the hell out of them.

I mostly cook Northern Italian cuisine, but venture into Mexican, Chinese, Indian/South Asian, French, and American Southern.

I often make charcuterie/cheese boards, pasta from scratch (lasagna and baked pastas too), breads, cheeses like ricotta and mascarpone, desserts like tiramisu and puff pastry, tarts, pies, cakes, cookies, stock, pizza, panini, egg dishes (crepes, soufflé, omelettes, etc).

Here's what I currently own:

- 2x stainless clad skillets (9"" / 11"")
- cast-iron skillet
- enameled cast-iron dutch oven
- enameled cast-iron braiser
- immersion blender
- wired probe thermometer

Things I'll definitely need to replace:

- Stand mixer
- food processor
- frying pan(s)
- saucepan(s)
- stock pot
- baking sheets etc
- knives inc. chef's knife and stones
- prep bowls
- mixing bowls
- storage containers
- basically everything when it comes to utensils. I have a cheese knife, a bench scraper, and a few other random things. I was taught using wood utensils, should I switch to silicone given this opportunity?

355,"Hey /r/Cooking! I'm a long time reader, and maybe I've posted before. That's irrelevant! Let's just get right into the meat of the thing.

I'm basically a child. I'm a 29 year old woman and my palate is not as refined as it could be. I've come a long way since leaving my mom's house at 18, tried a lot of new foods I previously didn't like (as it turns out, my mom's a horrible cook). I now like most meats, but veggies are the real problem. I like corn and potatoes, occasionally green pepper (but it can't be too cooked -- tender crisp is as cooked as it can get), a bit of satueed zucchini, and that's about it. Recently, I tried carrots from my pot roast and while the taste didn't kill me, the texture did. Most things that I don't like are because I am super finicky about textures. I absolutely cannot eat cabbage of any sort, I've tried it many times and hated the taste and texture every time. Same with broccoli. 

I'm so willing to try new things, because I'm struggling to eat healthier. As it turns out, when your diet subsists of a protein and a starch only, maybe a carb thrown in, you probably will have a hard time losing weight because many of those previously mentioned things are high in calories. I'm very into rich foods, I love making sauces and tossing things in a pan to experiment. I just haven't branched out to veggies.

I really want to try some sort of sweet glazed carrot recipe. If veggies can be sweet, I'll have a much easier time of eating them. I'm really sensitive to bitter flavors, they make me gag every time. Sometimes I'll do fruit smoothies with a handful or two of fresh spinach to get some kind of vegetable in me. 

Help me stop being such a child! I want to figure out a way to eat better foods, so eventually, I can figure out how to lose some weight. I know that abs start in the kitchen, and that I can work out all day and still not be able to lose as much because I'm eating poorly.

363,"**Background:** 

I was curious how much salt is in a ""pinch"", so I did an experiment. 

**Variables:** 

1) The type of salt you use

2) How many fingers you use

**Method:**

I used four different types of salt along with four different pinches. A one-finger pinch means your thumb and index finger. A two-finger pinch means your thumb, index, and middle fingers. And so on. I did each pinch three times to confirm they were all the same. I dropped the salt onto a sheet of paper, and then funneled it into a measuring spoon. 

**Control:** 

I am a 6'1"" grown-ass man of average build, hands/fingers average size. Your amounts may vary slightly. 

**Summary:**

Measured amounts range from as little as 1/16th of a teaspoon up to nearly (but not quite) 1 teaspoon. Table salt, being the finest, was the most difficult to pinch in large amounts. Coarse sea salt, being the coarsest, was the easiest to pinch into large amounts.

I tried the other day, and realized I couldn't buy Golden Syrup anywhere near me so I made my own with a recipe I found online and it came out awful. Fair enough, I ordered the real deal on amazon and tried again tonight. I made my pie crust yesterday, and tonight I was ready to nail this pie for my girl.  Here is the recipe:

[text](https://www.bingingwithbabish.com/recipes/2017/6/27/harrypotterspecial)

[video](https://youtu.be/LXDAu8DnALw?t=208)

After blind baking the pie crust, it came out looking terrible. I know the filling is going to get underneath the crust but i'm trying it anyway. [Here are pictures of the crust](https://imgur.com/a/twVHcQe)

The other day when I made it the crust flattened out and didn't cover the edge too. I didn't let the pie come to room temp before rolling it out, and also I used rice as pie weights which was way too light. Tonight I let it sit at room temp for about 45 mins before rolling it out, and it was still a little colder than room temp but easy to roll.

The other day when I made it the crust flattened out and didn't cover the edge too. I didn't let the pie come to room temp before rolling it out, and also I used rice as pie weights which was way too light. Tonight I let it sit at room temp for about 45 mins before rolling it out, and it was still a little colder than room temp but easy to roll.

386,"Today, I wanted to show you how to make a classic Cantonese dish, scrambled eggs with shrimp.

This’s a pretty easy and straightforward dish, all things considered. To be honest, you could just cook up some shrimp, toss them into some eggs scrambled the way you like them, and have relatively competent ‘shrimp and eggs’. So what I’d like to do is really zero in on the two titular ingredients, and show you (1) how to prepare shrimp in the Cantonese style, which allows the shrimp to keep their pop through cooking and (2) how to achieve that silky, slightly runny texture that’s so characteristic of Cantonese scrambled eggs.

[Video is here if you’d like a visual to follow along](https://youtu.be/L7JvXUj_usI).

**Ingredients:**

1.	*Shell-on shrimp (虾仁), 200g.* Smaller shrimp are better. Fresh shrimp in an ideal world, though for reference, after peeling I was looking at ~100g IIRC.

2.	*Marinade for the shrimp: ¼ tsp salt, ¼ tsp sugar, a tiny sprinkle white pepper powder (白胡椒粉), ¼ tsp liaojiu a.k.a. Shaoxing wine (料酒/绍兴酒), ½ tsp peanut oil.* The white pepper was something on the order of 1/16th of a teaspoon, I figured at that point it didn’t make much sense to measure it. Now, besides the wine this dish would be a member of our ‘Western supermarket club’, so if that’s the only ingredient you’re missing, swap it for a different wine. Everyone recommends sherry, but honestly I think a white wine would be just fine as well.

3.	*Eggs, 5 medium.* Or about 250 grams worth. In the video, I used a certain kind of egg that has a particularly vibrant yolk – if my memory’s serving me right, that’s not really an option abroad. It’s not important, but it’s something to know just in case the final color of your scrambled eggs doesn’t look quite like mine.

4.	*Seasoning for the egg: 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp sugar, 1 tsp cornstarch (生粉) mixed with a touch of water to make a slurry, ½ tsp liaojiu a.k.a. Shaoxing wine (料酒/绍兴酒), optional sprinkle of MSG (味精), optional 2 tsp melted lard (猪油), 1 tsp toasted sesame oil (麻油).* So a couple things here. First, the cornstarch. Cornstarch has a really cool function here – it helps ensure that the egg doesn’t squeeze out as much moisture as it cooks, improving the final texture of the scrambled egg (really, a nice technique to apply to *any* scrambled egg dish). Second, while we do call for lard here (because it’s awesome), don’t let lack of lard make you not cook the dish. Just use lard if you can, skip if you can’t.

5.	*Scallions (葱), ~5g.* Sliced, green portion of the scallion. 

6.	*Melted Lard (猪油) -or- Peanut oil, for frying, ~3tbsp.* So the reason I’m listing this out here is because this’s gunna be absorbed into the egg in the end. Yeah, this isn’t diet food (unless you happen to be one of those keto folks). Again, use lard if you can – eggs cooked with lard is a classic combination in Cantonese cooking – but don’t stress if you have to use another oil. Peanut is another common go-to, and honestly I think ghee/clarified butter might taste good here too, though I’ve never tried it.

**Process:**

So before we get into this, first know that there’s really almost as many ways to scramble eggs as there are chefs in China. So while I’ll introduce the method *we* like, don’t freak out if that contradicts something you’ve already learned. There’s a multitude of different ways to skin this cat.

1.	*Peel your shrimp, devein if you’re in the mood.* When I’m cooking for myself, I basically never devein small shrimp. There’s zero health reason to do it, the vein’s not a concentrated source of contaminants, de-veining’s a palpable pain in the ass, and I’m convinced that no one would be able to tell in a blind taste test. That said, aesthetically it’s a reasonable ask for large shrimp, and I do seem to find myself quickly tweezing out any shrimp with dark, super obvious veins. I know that some people are really… passionate… on the subject, so do whatever you like.

2.	*Rinse the shrimp under running water for 15 minutes.* Like most fish/seafood, shrimp got a bit of surface slime that helps keep parasites away and such – this is between their shell and their body. Ever wonder why peeled shrimp sometimes don’t really keep their pop throughout cooking? That’s because you didn’t de-slime the guy. Toss in a bowl, and toss the bowl under running water for ~15 minutes. That’ll get most of that stuff off. As an aside, a baking soda brine works in much the same way, so you could alternatively do that if you’re more comfortable with it (though sodium carbonate – baked baking soda – or alkaline water would work better).

3.	*While the shrimp is rinsing, nuke the lard to melt it, if using.* Or whenever, your mise is up to you. I personally just don’t like adding warm lard to uncooked eggs so I do it in advance. But I’m probably paranoid.

4.	*Thoroughly dry the shrimp.* After the rinse, the shrimp should look obviously ‘white’. If they don’t, evaluate how much you care. If the answers ‘a lot’, rinse them for longer; otherwise, it’s probably good enough for government work. Pat the shrimp dry, then move them over to a kitchen cloth. Curl up the kitchen cloth to *really* get those shrimp dry. Why do this additional drying process? Not sure, but it seems to work. I’d guess it’s actually less about drying them, and more about removing any remaining surface slime.

5.	*Marinate the shrimp.* Toss in all the shrimp marinade ingredients sans the oil, mix that real well, then squirt in the oil and coat well. Marinate for at least 10 minutes.

6.	*Stir fry the shrimp for about ~45 seconds until they’ve changed color, then toss in a strainer to drain of any excess oil.* As always, first *longyau*: get that wok piping hot, shut off the heat, add in the oil – here about 3-4 tbsp – and give it a swirl to get a nice non-stick surface. With your flame on high now, toss in the shrimp. Here we’re stir-frying with a rather sizable quantity of oil relative to the amount of meat we’re using – this oily stir fry helps the shrimp cook more evenly and is about halfway to the ‘passing through oil’ method (which I didn’t do primarily out of laziness, and hey, for this small-ish quantity of shrimp this’ll do the job). Once your shrimp’ve changed color, dip them out into a strainer. Let them cool down a bit and the oil drain off.

7.	*Crack open the eggs, add in all the seasoning except the oils. Beat the eggs thoroughly.* So you’ll read want to go at this, or in the words of another /r/cooking user that I stole this from “beat the snot [i.e. egg whites] out of them”. You’re looking for the eggs to be slightly frothy and have no stray strands of egg white remaining. Bonus points are awarded for doing this step with chopsticks, but whisking it like you might be used to is obviously ok as well.

8.	*Add in the melted lard, the sesame oil, the shrimp, and the scallions. Quick mix.*

9.	*Scramble.* So the technique here that we’re doing is the layering method. Basically, the idea is that you’ll scoop up the cooked eggs from the bottom of the wok and toss them on top of eachother so they don’t overcook – it makes for really silky, slightly runny eggs. To do it, you’ll want one burner on high and another burner to rest your wok on - otherwise you’ll need to fiddle with the flame like we did in the video (also, note that this’s for carbon steel woks, if using cast iron check out the note below). Then of course, first longyau: piping hot wok, heat off, three tablespoons of lard or oil, swirl to get your non-stick surface. 

* Heat the oil up over high heat until it rapidly forms around a pair of chopsticks, ~190C.

* Take the wok off the heat. Add in the eggs. It will quickly puff and the bottom will set.

 * Scoop the set bottom up, letting the running bit drain off, and place it slightly to the side. 

* Return the wok to the heat. Once the eggs are starting to bubble around the edges, ~10 seconds, take it back off the heat. 

* Scoop the set bottom up, letting the running bit drain off, and place it on top of your other set eggs.

* Repeat until your eggs are cooked to your liking. For reference, we did this a total of six times in the video. If I’m eating this with rice, sometimes I like it a bit runnier and smothering them over the rice. 

**Note on boiling shrimp:**

Ok, so if you happen to want a shortcut here, totally understandable. What I might suggest is boiling the shrimp shell-on in place of frying them.

If you boil the shrimp… no need for the rinsing, no need for the marinade. Just take the shrimp and pop them in rapidly boiling water. Once the shrimp are *just* starting to float (I usually only wait until it’s one or two shrimp floating), ~45 seconds, strain them and rinse under cool water to stop the cooking process.

This is how I usually cook shrimp for myself. Why? Well… I’m enormously spoiled living in China. When I buy shrimp from the market, they’re still kicking. Run home, toss the still-live shrimp in the boiling water to cook, immediately cover with a lid… doesn’t get any fresher than that (before anyone complains that this is ‘cruel to shrimp’, people regularly commit chemical warfare in cold blood against cockroaches and nobody bats an eye). Plus, cooked shrimp are easier to peel.

In any event, that’s one route you can take. We didn’t do that for this recipe because 95% of the time, you see this dish with fried shrimp.

**Note on using cast iron woks:**        

So you know how we repeatedly put the wok on the heat, and took it off? Yeah, that’s for a carbon steel wok. If you’re working on cast iron, those’ll obviously retain heat. From what I can tell, if working with cast iron you basically just need to heat it up once, then shut off the flame and let the residual heat do all the work.",Recipe: Cantonese Scrambled Eggs and Shrimp (滑蛋虾仁),Cooking,"Today, I wanted to show you how to make a classic Cantonese dish, scrambled eggs with shrimp.

Curl up the kitchen cloth to *really* get those shrimp dry. Why do this additional drying process? Not sure, but it seems to work. I’d guess it’s actually less about drying them, and more about removing any remaining surface slime.

5.	*Marinate the shrimp.* Toss in all the shrimp marinade ingredients sans the oil, mix that real well, then squirt in the oil and coat well. Marinate for at least 10 minutes.

6.	*Stir fry the shrimp for about ~45 seconds until they’ve changed color, then toss in a strainer to drain of any excess oil.* As always, first *longyau*: get that wok piping hot, shut off the heat, add in the oil – here about 3-4 tbsp – and give it a swirl to get a nice non-stick surface. With your flame on high now, toss in the shrimp. Here we’re stir-frying with a rather sizable quantity of oil relative to the amount of meat we’re using – this oily stir fry helps the shrimp cook more evenly and is about halfway to the ‘passing through oil’ method (which I didn’t do primarily out of laziness, and hey, for this small-ish quantity of shrimp this’ll do the job). Once your shrimp’ve changed color, dip them out into a strainer. Let them cool down a bit and the oil drain off.

7.	*Crack open the eggs, add in all the seasoning except the oils. Beat the eggs thoroughly.* So you’ll read want to go at this, or in the words of another /r/cooking user that I stole this from “beat the snot [i.e. egg whites] out of them”. You’re looking for the eggs to be slightly frothy and have no stray strands of egg white remaining. Bonus points are awarded for doing this step with chopsticks, but whisking it like you might be used to is obviously ok as well.

8.	*Add in the melted lard, the sesame oil, the shrimp, and the scallions. Quick mix.*

9.	*Scramble.* So the technique here that we’re doing is the layering method. Basically, the idea is that you’ll scoop up the cooked eggs from the bottom of the wok and toss them on top of eachother so they don’t overcook – it makes for really silky, slightly runny eggs. To do it, you’ll want one burner on high and another burner to rest your wok on - otherwise you’ll need to fiddle with the flame like we did in the video (also, note that this’s for carbon steel woks, if using cast iron check out the note below). Then of course, first longyau: piping hot wok, heat off, three tablespoons of lard or oil, swirl to get your non-stick surface. 

* Heat the oil up over high heat until it rapidly forms around a pair of chopsticks, ~190C.

* Take the wok off the heat. Add in the eggs. It will quickly puff and the bottom will set.

 * Scoop the set bottom up, letting the running bit drain off, and place it slightly to the side. 

* Return the wok to the heat. Once the eggs are starting to bubble around the edges, ~10 seconds, take it back off the heat. 

* Scoop the set bottom up, letting the running bit drain off, and place it on top of your other set eggs.

* Repeat until your eggs are cooked to your liking. For reference, we did this a total of six times in the video. If I’m eating this with rice, sometimes I like it a bit runnier and smothering them over the rice. 

**Note on boiling shrimp:**

Ok, so if you happen to want a shortcut here, totally understandable. What I might suggest is boiling the shrimp shell-on in place of frying them.

If you boil the shrimp… no need for the rinsing, no need for the marinade. Just take the shrimp and pop them in rapidly boiling water. Once the shrimp are *just* starting to float (I usually only wait until it’s one or two shrimp floating), ~45 seconds, strain them and rinse under cool water to stop the cooking process.

This is how I usually cook shrimp for myself. Why? Well… I’m enormously spoiled living in China. When I buy shrimp from the market, they’re still kicking. Run home, toss the still-live shrimp in the boiling water to cook, immediately cover with a lid… doesn’t get any fresher than that (before anyone complains that this is ‘cruel to shrimp’, people regularly commit chemical warfare in cold blood against cockroaches and nobody bats an eye). Plus, cooked shrimp are easier to peel.

In any event, that’s one route you can take. We didn’t do that for this recipe because 95% of the time, you see this dish with fried shrimp.

**Note on using cast iron woks:**        

So you know how we repeatedly put the wok on the heat, and took it off? Yeah, that’s for a carbon steel wok. If you’re working on cast iron, those’ll obviously retain heat. From what I can tell, if working with cast iron you basically just need to heat it up once, then shut off the flame and let the residual heat do all the work.Recipe: Cantonese Scrambled Eggs and Shrimp (滑蛋虾仁)"

I use radish in my homemade salsa fresca.  (raw vegetables only in this recipe).  Radish naturally neutralizes acidity, whereas sugar only masks the taste.   I don’t use sugar or vinegar in salsa fresca.    radish blends right in with the fresh vegetables. 

**RECIPE INGREDIENTS**

•plum tomatoes(however many you prefer for consistency, but I usually use around 10-13)

•1 red onion

•5 radish, 

•Fresh Parsley/Cilantro(depending on taste)

•1 fresh lime (juice and zest) maybe two but only zest one.

•6 Jalepeno peppers

•4 Habanero Peppers(amount depends on how hot you want it.  I usually use 4 or 5)

•3 cherry peppers 

•3 Serrano peppers 

•1 Poblano pepper

•Salt and Pepper to taste, but I don’t use that much.

**RECIPE PROCESS**

Blend every thing but the tomatoes first.   A food processor is easier to get the consistency you want.   Deseed everything.  Then either add the tomatoes and blend them a little less, or hand cut for chunkier salsa. (That’s the way I do it anyway).    You can control how Spicey it is based on the amount of habaneros you use.   That makes by far the most difference.

What do you think, which spices are particularly worth spending money on? Not in absolute price, but in terms of buying high or low quality? Is investing into expensive cumin actually worth it? I often buy TRS stuff from the local ethnic stores.

I also bought some eco spices and they were superior but not extremely impressive. I once had dried turmeric that was really good, and I prefer cinnamon that is more expensive simply because most of the cheap cinnamon is cassia.

Based on a recommendation here on reddit I am planning on buying at [regencyspices.hk](https://regencyspices.hk/). Any other recommendations for Europe? Right now I'm probably going for Cinnamon, Cardamom, maybe Fennel... that's what I need to refill.

Coriander, Cumin and Turmeric are also used a lot in my kitchen but I have the weird feeling I can just stick to the normal brands... am I wrong? I sometimes cook with Mace and Black Cardamom as well, and I love curry leaves, but they are not available freshly and I think the dried ones are pretty dull... Are there any spices you considered to exotic or unimportant that turned out to be game changers for you?

Any recommendations welcome :) 

Thanks ahead!",Which spices are worth paying higher prices for? With considerable increases in quality along the price spectrum?,Cooking,"I'm going to get spices shipped soon. I mainly need them for Indian food.

What do you think, which spices are particularly worth spending money on? Not in absolute price, but in terms of buying high or low quality? Is investing into expensive cumin actually worth it? I often buy TRS stuff from the local ethnic stores.

I also bought some eco spices and they were superior but not extremely impressive. I once had dried turmeric that was really good, and I prefer cinnamon that is more expensive simply because most of the cheap cinnamon is cassia.

- 3 tins kidney beans
- dried lentils 
- a packet of cheesy instant ramen noodles
- various dried and spicy chile peppers
- butter
- rice
- rice seasoning 
- arborio rice
- pine nuts
- flour

493,"So I had an idea that tonight I would like to make roasted crispy skin chicken thighs on a bed of homemade sauerkraut that has a noticeable caraway seed flavor. To it I plan to add some baby carrots kind of buried in the kraut to flavor them. As long as I dont overcook them they should retain their sweetness. Normally when I do bone in skin on I put it in a roasting pan and cover with aluminum foil to bake until the last half hour when I uncover it to ensure the skin gets crispy.  So my first question is, can I just do it that way without overcooking the sauerkraut or will it turn to mush? I was thinking if it will get to mushy, maybe I should just cook the entire time without aluminum... but I dont know if that will work either or just dry out the kraut to much.

I plan a side of cheesy scalloped potatoes for a salty creamy carb. But I am also considering a bread. Which would be better though, a simple sweet home baked loaf, or a honey sweetened sourdough bread?  Im thinking the kraut and potatoes and eating meat off the bone are enough chewing work, maybe I should make a softer bread lol.

Onions are the base for a lot of my dishes. I love caramelize onions, and make them two ways: with and without baking soda. The end product is totally different. Other than the addition of about a 1/4 tsp of baking soda, these batches were cooked exactly the same- olive oil, salt and low heat. These two batches were cooked for the same length of time as well. They were in different pan types (cast iron,  non stick), but I regularly make either type in both pans. 

Without baking soda, the end result are individual pieces of onion that retain a lot of structure and texture. With baking soda, they melt into a purée. I use this method when I’m adding the onions to goats cheese for a sauce/spread, or blending them into lentils, using them for a soup base or anything else where I want the onion flavor, but not tiny pieces. 

The baking soda also makes them cook significantly faster, which is a serious perk! ",Sautéing onions with and without baking soda,Cooking,"https://imgur.com/gallery/3LVwtWX

521,"I’ve always had trouble with this being too chunky/fibery instead of very smooth. I tweaked a couple of things with the recipe I’d been using and it ended up coming out amazing! [Photo](https://imgur.com/a/mguhk6y) I’m currently eating it hot and it’s delicious, hopefully it’ll be just as good tomorrow when chilled. EDIT: oh my GOD, it’s 1000% better chilled. 

Recipe:

 * 1.75oz butter
 * 1 onion, chopped fine
 * 4 leeks, white part only, thinly sliced
 * 1 garlic clove, chopped fine (this is what the recipe says, let your heart be your guide here. I put in a whole head.)
 * 7oz potatoes, chopped (roughly two mediumish russets)
 * 4 cups chicken stock
 * 1 cup cream
 * salt
 * white pepper
 * chives, chopped fine

Melt the butter in a large saucepan or stockpot. Add onion, leek, and garlic. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened and see-through but not browned. Add potato and stock and boil. 

Once boiling reduce heat, cover, and simmer 20 minutes or until potatoes are cooked through. Remove from heat and let cool 10-15 minutes. Purée using food processor or tabletop/immersion blender and return to pot if applicable. 

Gently bring soup back to the boil and stir in cream. Season to taste with salt and pepper and reheat without boiling. Serve hot or chilled, garnished with chives. 

The changes I had to make were basically three things: not using enough liquid, not using some of the more greenish parts of the leek that were harder to break down, and using an immersion blender instead of a regular blender. The recipe originally called for 2.5 cups of stock and 3/4 cup of cream, I put in 4 cups and 1 cup respectively. For the leeks I used only the bulb and saved the stalks for another recipe, since the stalks are a lot harder to get softened and blended. That meant I had to buy one more leek than originally called for, but whatever. And the difference between a regular blender/food processor and an immersion blender is INSANE. What used to take me 15 minutes now takes me three. I’m in love with my new toy.

523,"I got a Halogen Oven a couple of months ago. I read only incredible comments and reviews on halogen ovens relating to their cooking ability, speed, and efficiency, but I’ve been struggling with it and hoping to get advice on using it from more experienced users.

Here are the issues I have with it at the moment:

1) It seems like I need to give constant attention to it, turning food over every 5-10 mins. Usually I could chuck things in my fan oven  and get away with leaving it, but the halogen oven only seems to cook the top and the bottom is soggy?
2) I don’t know how to cook larger amounts of food in it. If I want to cook enough for 6 people, I need to spread it across two layers but it doesn’t cook evenly as the top layer cooks faster. I can try swapping the tiers halfway through but, again, it seems like a lot more attention I need to give this thing.
3) I’m used to cooking large saucy meals in the oven like pasta bakes, lasagnes, or moussaka, but I can’t fit my trays inside the Halogen oven — how does one cook something like a lasagne in one? Do I just expel the trays and put the ingredients directly into the bottom of the glass bowl? Would this cook it throughout? How the heck do I get a slice of lasagne out in that scenario?

 At the moment I’m giving it the benefit of the doubt and want to try it a few more times, but I’m stumped how these devices have such great reviews!

Last night and the night before I have tried my hand at making pasta from scratch (need a pasta roller/cutter now too haha), and it turned out awesome.  Made pasta ail e olio and pasta cacio e pepe (watch a little too much Binging with Babish), and the difference of homemade noodles is incredible.

548,"I've been making the same balsamic vinaigrette for a while now. But I wanted to confirm my thinking with you folks.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a Oxo salad dressing shaker bottle so I know exactly that I use 100 mL of balsamic vinegar and 150 mL of EVOO, along with dijon mustard, spices, etc. Normally, I just shake vigorously to combine.

&amp;#x200B;

After using the dressing and putting it back in the fridge, the oil and vinegar separate and the oil solidifies. It's no big deal, I just microwave it for a few seconds and shake to combine. However, if you blend the dressing in a MagicBullet or similar blender bottle, it remains completely emulsified and combined.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm assuming the blending process melds the oil, vinegar and mustard together better and hence, the oil can't separate and solidify as easily. Do I have that right?

Cheese and Charcuterie - Creme Brie from F'rommager D'affinois, Blueberry Vanilla Bean Goat's Cheese, Fresh Mozzarella with EVOO, Parma Prosciutto, Coppa, Soppressatta + some accompaniments. 

Freshly Baked [White Mountain Bread](https://savortheflavour.com/easy-white-mountain-bread/) with Butter. 

Cobb Salad with Homemade [Buttermilk Ranch](http://www.laurainthekitchen.com/recipes/ranch-dressing/)

Reverse Seared Filet Mignon with Red Wine-Shallot Reduction on the Side. 

Blanched Asparagus with Butter and Sea Salt. 

Creamy Mashed Russets with Garlic and Chives. 

Elotes - Corn grilled with garlic-parmesan butter and mayo. Freaking awesome. 

- 

For dessert I made a dessert tray and got her a Napoleon from the Italian bakery, which our chihuahua proceeded to knock off the table and attempt to eat for herself. 


Overall, the meal was AWESOME. The steaks were my number one concern and they came out great, perfectly mid rare center. I cooked hers slightly more than mine (by about 5 degrees, since she prefers closer to medium rare and I prefer closer to rare). Both were extremely buttery and could cut with a fork. The potatoes also came out great, very smooth and creamy with just boiled potatoes, butter, and some cream + a good amount of salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and chives. For my mom I shredded up some white cheddar and cooked up some crispy bacon since she enjoys ""loaded mashed potatoes.""
The corn was also great. My mom says the street style corn is the best shes ever had. I just boil it, grill it in a grill pan, and I make a mayo mix with garlic, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and parsley and liberally brush the corn with it before dusting it with grated parmesan. 

Here are some photos of the meal + her present which was a new dining room table set :) we love it! Also, excuse the neon plates. They are her favorite and it was her birthday after all. If you have any questions about the preparation or how I made it all come together feel free to ask. Can't wait to hear your thoughts and feedback.

Yesterday, I decided to try making something completely on a whim, using leftover ingredients, and based on cooking techniques I've learned from recipes and Gordon Ramsay / Binging With Babish videos. 

\- Simmering and searing sausages to get fond

\- Chopped onion for aromatics, along with chunks of baby carrots

\- Deglazing all that good stuff with white wine

\- One good glug of chicken stock

\- Couple glugs of heavy cream to thicken

\- And to give some character, I melted a few loads of Parmesan cheese in it, as well as some cold butter to finish the texture.

\- Tossed in shell pasta that I cooked on the side, complete with a little pasta water, as well as chunks of my seared sausages.

\- Salt, pepper, minced parsley, the usual seasoning and prettifying process.

&amp;#x200B;

Had a bite. Damn, good stuff. It felt pretty special -- not some generic red or white sauce, this was golden-colored and pretty damn delicious, and it's something I can put my own name on! Maybe I can name it as my own little signature dish.

&amp;#x200B;

Turns out, of course not -- I just made Alfredo sauce the way it actually originated from Italy. Parmesan and butter, albeit with the addition of cream. Those stark-white Alfredo sauce jars found in supermarkets just got their color from eggs and other added stuff.

604,"So - I am cooking dinner tonight for my girlfriend and I. I bought some really nice King Salmon yesterday from a local fishmonger, and I planned on grilling them on a cedar plank with some fresh lemon, dill, and other spices alongside some grilled veggie skewers. 

I want to pair the salmon and veggies with a traditional risotto, however the problem I have is timing as risotto is definitely a labor of love and attention. Since our grill is on the apartment's rooftop, I can't be in two places at once which is going to make this difficult to execute IMO. 

Risotto needs to be served hot and immediately, so I think the best course of action is to under cook the risotto ahead of time, grab salmon and skewers, heat up the grill, get the shit on and close the lid, go back downstairs to my kitchen to finish heating up and plate risotto, go back up to rooftop and take salmon/veggies off. 

I have never grilled with a soaked cedar plank, and I've read that they need some extra attention due to the possibility of the wood igniting which leaves me a little skeptical of just shutting the lid and forgetting about the fish and vegs.

652," Hi everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

**Here's my coconut &amp; carrot cookies!** The name pretty much says it all, they're cookies made with diced carrots and shredded coconut. They turned out pretty good, **I think they're a nice snack or a fix for your sweet tooth.** I can't wait to share them with you!

&amp;#x200B;

**They don't require any butter, sugar of flour.** All you need are some ingredients, a bowl and your sexy hands (wait what?).

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what you'll need:

&amp;#x200B;

\- **Oat Flour** (or instant oats - 100g)

\- **1 Egg** \- I used Medium Sized

\- **Peanut Butter** (60g)

\- **Dates** (3 Small Dates = 25g)

\- **Protein Powder** (1 scoop = 25g) (Your flavor of choice)

\- **Carrots** (70g - this was half of a medium carrot)

\- **Shredded Coconut** (30g)

\- **Coconut Oil** (10g)

\- **Cinnamon** (2g)

\- **Baking Powder** (1g)

&amp;#x200B;

Time to bake some cookies!

&amp;#x200B;

Before you start:

&amp;#x200B;

**Boil the carrots for 2-3 minutes to soften them up** and so that you won't get any raw carrots in your cookies.

**Pre-heat your oven to 180ºC (360F).**

\--

**STEP 1: Add the oat flour, shredded coconut, protein powder** and **carrots** into a bowl, as well as the **cinnamon** and **baking powder.** Give it a **slight mix.**

**STEP 2: Add the peanut butter, coconut oil,** chopped **dates** and the **egg.**

**STEP 3: Knead the dough with your hands.** Feel that dough, let it talk to you. (You'll get a better perception of the consistency and whether it needs more flour or peanut butter).

**STEP 4: Grease a tray.**

**STEP 5: Shape** the cookie dough into cookies.

**STEP 6: Cook for 15 minutes at 180ºC** (360ºF).

&amp;#x200B;

(I cooked mine for 20 minutes and they were a bit on the crunchier side, you can get a creamier texture with 15 min).

Voilá!

&amp;#x200B;

They're done!

&amp;#x200B;

These cookies are delicious, I really like them. BUT! (There's always a but), **even though I like the coconut flavor, it packs a lot of fat** so if you're looking for an option with less fat, you can remove the coconut from this recipe, it will still taste amazing.

&amp;#x200B;

653,"I hope this kind of question is allowed here. I did try to google for an answer but it seems most people aren’t trying to ruin their vegetable soup.

I think the easiest way to explain this is to simply go through the scene:

Emmalyn, a princess who has ran away from home wants to impress Delphyne by surprising her with a vegetable soup when she comes home. Emmalyn has never cooked anything in her life and she’s going to mess it up in some way. When the Delphyne returns home, she finds the Emmalyn cooking and to Emmalyn’s pleasure goes and scoops out a plate of soup. However, Delphyne has, without having tasted it, recognized what is wrong with it. So instead of eating it herself, she sets the plate down in front of Emmalyn and hands her a spoon. Emmalyn tastes it and its terrible. Delphyne then explains what Emmalyn did wrong and offers her to make a vegetable soup together.

A few more things to take into account: The setting is medieval, so I would like to avoid modern ingredients. The time of year is winter. This one is less of a deal breaker but it would be nice to match the season. And to make it a little easier: Emmalyn is cooking over an open fire. There’s certainly the possibility for her to boil something to oblivion. She could also grab anything she might find in a kitchen and throw it there, or use parts vegetables that should be removed.

What is a good mistake for her to make? How would someone recognize it without tasting? How would the result taste?

This is a dish from a local Chinese restaurant, and I'm trying to crack the ingredients, but I haven't been able to replicate it too well so far. I think I've got the batter down okay (a corn starch &amp; flour mix, I'm pretty sure), but it's the sauce I am curious about..there is minced garlic, chili flakes of some sort, and possibly a paste which I'm unsure of, but it isn't something like Thai Sweet Chili Sauce.

665,"Hello there,

not to offend anybody, but I got a couple of good quality dry aged Ribeye Steaks that I don't like. Bought them as a whole piece, cut individual Steaks from it and then froze them in cryovaced bags. If I prepare them in my usual way (Salt, Pepper, baste with butter in the Pan) they are too funky for my taste.

Now, what could I try? Maybe some marinades, spice mixes, sauces? I usually don't do rubs or anything on a good Steak, but now might be a good time to try. Any favorites?

After making up my vegetable stock base I with onion, carrot, parsnip and celery I didnt have any chicken bullion so I used some MSG, red chilis and tajin. Wow, so good. Added some cooked and cut up some chicken breast, spiral pasta, peas and a little cilantro. No idea what you'd call this soup, reminded me a lot of a minestrone minus beans.

670,"So happy Saturday, it's my mom's birthday today and I'm making her a steak tonight but last night for an early birthday dinner we decided to have some delicious Italian food. It's been a while since I've done some cooking so it felt great to get back in the kitchen. Here's what I made -

- Pull Apart Garlic Bread
- Cheese and Charcuterie Platter 

- Veal Chops Saltimbocca alla Milanese - Veal Tomahawk Ribeye stuffed with Parma Prosciutto, Fontina, and breaded with homemade breadcrumbs. Than pan fried, finished in a 400 degree oven, and drizzled with warm Balsamic Glaze. 
- Spaghetti Aglio e Olio - Spaghetti with Garlic and Olive Oil
- Broccolini sautéed with Sliced Garlic, Olive Oil, and Lemon

For dessert we did a dessert bar, with a combo of treats we made. I made the fudge, chocolate covered pretzels, and cannolis and my mom chocolate dipped the strawberries. We ended up wanting some milkshakes too so I made her a chocolate one with Blue Bell Dutch Chocolate Ice Cream and Promised Land Chocolate Milk (if you can find this at your grocery store, I implore you to get it) and I made a vanilla milkshake with Blue Bell Homemade Vanilla, a splash of milk, and vanilla extract. 

Now before I tell you how the food was, story time... everything was going well. Was 7:45, table was set, pasta was about to be plated, and I asked my mom if she could bring over the garlic bread and some orange juice to the table. No problem. She does, we're standing around getting ready to make our plates, and we hear a HUGE bang. What the hell was that?!
She ran in to the dining room and goes... uh.... the kitchen table just literally cracked. We've had a glass table for awhile which recently suffered a little crack, and um, it just cracked off! Then she goes ""all that was lost was a tray of crackers!"" LMAO. So all the food was hot and ready but we had to change plans. The veal chops were $30 a pop before adding prosciutto to em so I did not want to sacrifice them, so I turned off the stovetop, covered the pan of broccolini, and pasta with a lid, and stuck the veal and garlic bread in a 200 degree oven to stay warm. We cleaned up really quickly, and set up a foldable picnic table in our living room with chairs, with a tablecloth, placemats, and silverware, and by 8:20 we were sitting down. All of the food was perfect. The veal literally cut with a butter knife, I have never tasted such high quality meat. I am honestly amazed that I cooked it. The broccolini lost it's bright green from sitting in the steamy pan but it was not mushy so I was satisfied. The only thing that got a bit messy, was the pasta, the noodles got a bit sticky and not as silky as I would've liked from sitting for a while, but I had some homemade marinara sauce and frankly, it was perfectly fine. 

Here's some photos of the meal, and process, start to finish! What do you all think? Also trying to work on those photography skills with this new phone camera.

682,"This morning I read an article on Gizmodo called ""The Pyrex Glass Controversy that Just Won't Die,"" ([https://gizmodo.com/the-pyrex-glass-controversy-that-just-wont-die-1833040962](https://gizmodo.com/the-pyrex-glass-controversy-that-just-wont-die-1833040962)) about how Pyrex changed from being made of borosilicate glass to being made of soda-lime glass, and now supposedly breaks if you expose it to heat or rapid temperature changes (the things that Pyrex was made to be able to handle).

One of the comments said this:

&gt;At least real borosilicate glass - if you know enough to look for it - appears to still be plentifully available in the market, and cheap. If the actual product had become rare and expensive, while the brand noted for it charged premium prices for inferior product, THAT would be a shame. But this way, educated consumers can still get the good stuff for a good price.

Thanks!","Where to find ""real"" Pyrex?",Cooking,"This morning I read an article on Gizmodo called ""The Pyrex Glass Controversy that Just Won't Die,"" ([https://gizmodo.com/the-pyrex-glass-controversy-that-just-wont-die-1833040962](https://gizmodo.com/the-pyrex-glass-controversy-that-just-wont-die-1833040962)) about how Pyrex changed from being made of borosilicate glass to being made of soda-lime glass, and now supposedly breaks if you expose it to heat or rapid temperature changes (the things that Pyrex was made to be able to handle).

One of the comments said this:

&gt;At least real borosilicate glass - if you know enough to look for it - appears to still be plentifully available in the market, and cheap. If the actual product had become rare and expensive, while the brand noted for it charged premium prices for inferior product, THAT would be a shame. But this way, educated consumers can still get the good stuff for a good price.

*INGREDIENTS*

Tomatoes : 4, 28 oz cans. 2 of crushed. 1 of diced. 1 of petite diced. (Quality is important here. Get the good kind, not generic.)

Garlic : 10 nice fresh cloves.

Cilantro : 2 big handfulls.

Salt : 4 tsp.

Olive Oil : 1 Tbsp.

Anaheim Peppers, crushed dried : 1 Tbsp. (We're talking like what you sprinkle on your pizza. Get good peppers cheap at the co-op in the spices section.)

Vidalia Onion : 1, smallish-medium.

*PROCEDURE*

Cook the garlic a little. This is an important step. It will enhance the garlic flavor, cut the rawness (which can upset your stomach) and make it easier to peel. Take your 10 unpeeled cloves and put them on a small dish. Put the dish in the microwave. Cook until you can hear the cloves just start to pop and sing. It'll take 5-10 seconds. Then take your cloves out of the microwave. They'll be hot. Set the dish of garlic aside to cool.

Now get a big bowl.

Dump your 4 cans of tomatoes into the bowl.

Put salt, olive oil and peppers in the bowl.

Chop up your onion medium-fine. Put it in the bowl.

Chop up your cilantro. Put it in the bowl.

Get the garlic cloves. They should be cool enough to handle by now. Peel them. For each clove, mash it with the flat of a broad knife. Then take all of your mashed cloves and mince em up a bit. Then add the mashed minced garlic to the bowl.

Stir the contents of the bowl with a big spoon. Mix until it's all mixed up.

That's your fresh salsa. It tastes good now but it will taste better after you let it cure a bit.

Put the salsa in jars or tupperware or whatever. Put it in the fridge. Wait 3 days.

**If you want to know more details, here is the video link:** [**https://youtu.be/awEus4N9Zn8**](https://youtu.be/awEus4N9Zn8) 

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients for the stuffed tofu** 

* 2 packs of tofu (600 grams)
* 5.5 ounces of ground pork 
* 4 pieces of mushroom, diced (soaked with 1/2 cup+1/3 of water 3 hours in advance. Save the soaking liquid.)
* 3/8 tsp of salt
* 1 tsp of soy sauce
* 1/4 tsp of sugar
* 1/4 cup of spring onion
* 2 tsp of Chinese cooking wine

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients to season the mushroom soaking liquid**

* 1/2 + 1/3 cup of mushroom water
* 1/8 tsp of salt
* 1 tbsp of oyster sauce
* 1 tbsp of soy sauce
* Some white pepper to taste

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients to cook the tofu**

* 1/3 cup + 1 tbsp of the seasoned mushroom water
* 2.5 tbsp of oil to pan-fry the tofu

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients for the gravy**

* 1 tsp of oil
* 2 cloves of garlic, grated
* Few pieces of hot chilies, chopped
* 1.5 tsp of the white part of spring onion (reserve the green part for garnish)
* 1/2 cup + 1 tbsp of the seasoned mushroom water
* Cornstarch water (1.5 tsp of cornstarch + 2 tsp of water)

&amp;#x200B;

**INSTRUCTION**

* Soak 4 pieces of dry shitake mushrooms with 1/2 cup +1/3 of a cup of water. I did this 4 hours in advance. The mushrooms I used are small. If your mushroom is big, 2 pieces are enough. 
* Once they are nice and soft, squeeze the water out. Save the soaking liquid for later. Slice and dice the mushroom into fine little pieces. 
* In a big mixing bowl, add in 5.5 ounces of ground pork, 3/8 tsp of salt, 1/4 tsp of sugar, 1 tsp of soy sauce, 2 tsp of Chinese cooking wine, the mushroom and 1/4 cup of spring onion. Mix the filling until everything is well combined. Then stir it within one direction for 3-5 minutes. Throw and beat the filling to develop the texture until you can see some strings appearing. 
* I am using 2 packs of tofu. 300 grams each. You want to pick firm tofu for this recipe because it doesn’t break easily while you are frying and flipping them over. If you are not sure, check ingredients. If you see Glucono Lactone is on the list, that is the soft tofu. If you see Gypsum on the list, that is the one you need for this recipe. Mine is in Spanish. I couldn’t read but I can tell from the texture. 
* Cut the tofu into cubes. It depends on the size of your tofu. You don’t need to cut it the exact same size as mine. But overall, you want it to be big enough to make tofu container so we can stuff the filling in. 
* Take one piece. Use a dining knife. Cut along the edge. Be very gentle. Yes, they are firm tofu but they are still delicate. If this is the first time you are doing it, don’t stick the knife too deep, you don’t want to break the bottom. Once you cut a rectangle, carefully take out the middle part and there you go - a little tofu container. 
* You just keep doing that until you finish everything. You will have lots of extra tofu that you took out. If you don’t want to waste that, you can put it in soup such as egg drop soup or hot and sour soup. I know the shape doesn’t look good. But you are running restaurant right? Who cares? 
* Now we can stuff the tofu. This is the part when you can get your friends and families involved. It is like making dumplings but easier because you don’t need to wrap it. Take one tofu container. Use your thumb, forefinger and middle finger to support the edge of the tofu container so when you stuff the filling it, it won’t break easily. I finished all of them and I still go some filling left. Just split it into each piece to even it out. It is ok if you overstuff the tofu. Now you know how affordable this recipe is. We only used 5.5 ounces of meat. And this should be able to feed 2-3 people with some rice.
* Before we start cooking the tofu, let’s quickly make a sauce by using the mushroom soaking liquid. To that, add 1/8 tsp of salt, 1 tbsp of soy sauce, 1 tbsp of oyster sauce, and some white pepper to taste. You can also use black pepper. Mix it well. Make sure the oyster sauce is completely dissolved because that takes a while. Once you can not find any oyster sauce lumps, take out 1/3 cup + 1 tbsp of the sauce to another bowl. That is for cooking the tofu. There should be 1/2 cup + 1 tbsp of the liquid left which is for making the gravy. Don’t mess it up because the amount is different. 
* Get a large frying pan. Add some oil. Be generous with the amount. Toss the pan so the oil covers the bottom. Don’t need to wait for it to get hot. Just directly place in the tofu - filling side down. Tofu is basically protein and water cubes, If you put it in while the oil is hot, you will get hurt by the splashing. Just the let it fry on one side until the filling is golden brown. It will take about 4 minutes on medium heat. Then you can flip them over let it fry the other side. You can brown one side or all the surface. I did 3 sides. One thing I will like to mention. When your hand is above the frying pan and busy flipping the tofu, you can turn off the heat for a second to avoid oil splashing. Because tofu produces liquid while frying, that causes lots of splashing and it hurts. 
* Flip the tofu back to filling side up. I know, it looks like lots of chopstick work. Well, now it is time to practices. Pour in the seasoned mushroom liquid that we prepared for cooking the tofu. Cover it. Keep the flame on medium and wait until all the liquid is gone. If your lid is completely sealed, you need to leave a small gap so the steam can escape. Turn off the heat and take out the tofu. Set that aside and we are going to make the gravy. 
* In a sauce pot, add some oil, along with some grated garlic and some diced white parts of spring onion. I reserved the green part as garnish. I also like to add some hot chilies. This is optional. If you don’t eat spicy food, you don’t need to add it. Stir until fragrant. Pour in the liquid we made before. Bring it to a boil. Then add in some cornstarch water to thicken it (1.5 tsp of cornstarch + 2 tsp of water) and your gravy is done. Pour it over the tofu. Sprinkle some spring onion for garnish. You are ready to serve.

**Ingredients for the stuffed tofu** 

* 2 packs of tofu (600 grams)
* 5.5 ounces of ground pork 
* 4 pieces of mushroom, diced (soaked with 1/2 cup+1/3 of water 3 hours in advance. Save the soaking liquid.)
* 3/8 tsp of salt
* 1 tsp of soy sauce
* 1/4 tsp of sugar
* 1/4 cup of spring onion
* 2 tsp of Chinese cooking wine

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients to season the mushroom soaking liquid**

* 1/2 + 1/3 cup of mushroom water
* 1/8 tsp of salt
* 1 tbsp of oyster sauce
* 1 tbsp of soy sauce
* Some white pepper to taste

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients to cook the tofu**

* 1/3 cup + 1 tbsp of the seasoned mushroom water
* 2.5 tbsp of oil to pan-fry the tofu

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients for the gravy**

* 1 tsp of oil
* 2 cloves of garlic, grated
* Few pieces of hot chilies, chopped
* 1.5 tsp of the white part of spring onion (reserve the green part for garnish)
* 1/2 cup + 1 tbsp of the seasoned mushroom water
* Cornstarch water (1.5 tsp of cornstarch + 2 tsp of water)

&amp;#x200B;

**INSTRUCTION**

* Soak 4 pieces of dry shitake mushrooms with 1/2 cup +1/3 of a cup of water. I did this 4 hours in advance. The mushrooms I used are small. If your mushroom is big, 2 pieces are enough. 
* Once they are nice and soft, squeeze the water out. Save the soaking liquid for later. Slice and dice the mushroom into fine little pieces. 
* In a big mixing bowl, add in 5.5 ounces of ground pork, 3/8 tsp of salt, 1/4 tsp of sugar, 1 tsp of soy sauce, 2 tsp of Chinese cooking wine, the mushroom and 1/4 cup of spring onion. Mix the filling until everything is well combined. Then stir it within one direction for 3-5 minutes. Throw and beat the filling to develop the texture until you can see some strings appearing. 
* I am using 2 packs of tofu. 300 grams each. You want to pick firm tofu for this recipe because it doesn’t break easily while you are frying and flipping them over. If you are not sure, check ingredients. If you see Glucono Lactone is on the list, that is the soft tofu. If you see Gypsum on the list, that is the one you need for this recipe. Mine is in Spanish. I couldn’t read but I can tell from the texture. 
* Cut the tofu into cubes. It depends on the size of your tofu. You don’t need to cut it the exact same size as mine. But overall, you want it to be big enough to make tofu container so we can stuff the filling in. 
* Take one piece. Use a dining knife. Cut along the edge. Be very gentle. Yes, they are firm tofu but they are still delicate. If this is the first time you are doing it, don’t stick the knife too deep, you don’t want to break the bottom. Once you cut a rectangle, carefully take out the middle part and there you go - a little tofu container. 
* You just keep doing that until you finish everything. You will have lots of extra tofu that you took out. If you don’t want to waste that, you can put it in soup such as egg drop soup or hot and sour soup. I know the shape doesn’t look good. But you are running restaurant right? Who cares? 
* Now we can stuff the tofu. This is the part when you can get your friends and families involved. It is like making dumplings but easier because you don’t need to wrap it. Take one tofu container. Use your thumb, forefinger and middle finger to support the edge of the tofu container so when you stuff the filling it, it won’t break easily. I finished all of them and I still go some filling left. Just split it into each piece to even it out. It is ok if you overstuff the tofu. Now you know how affordable this recipe is. We only used 5.5 ounces of meat. And this should be able to feed 2-3 people with some rice.
* Before we start cooking the tofu, let’s quickly make a sauce by using the mushroom soaking liquid. To that, add 1/8 tsp of salt, 1 tbsp of soy sauce, 1 tbsp of oyster sauce, and some white pepper to taste. You can also use black pepper. Mix it well. Make sure the oyster sauce is completely dissolved because that takes a while. Once you can not find any oyster sauce lumps, take out 1/3 cup + 1 tbsp of the sauce to another bowl. That is for cooking the tofu. There should be 1/2 cup + 1 tbsp of the liquid left which is for making the gravy. Don’t mess it up because the amount is different. 
* Get a large frying pan. Add some oil. Be generous with the amount. Toss the pan so the oil covers the bottom. Don’t need to wait for it to get hot. Just directly place in the tofu - filling side down. Tofu is basically protein and water cubes, If you put it in while the oil is hot, you will get hurt by the splashing. Just the let it fry on one side until the filling is golden brown. It will take about 4 minutes on medium heat. Then you can flip them over let it fry the other side. You can brown one side or all the surface. I did 3 sides. One thing I will like to mention. When your hand is above the frying pan and busy flipping the tofu, you can turn off the heat for a second to avoid oil splashing. Because tofu produces liquid while frying, that causes lots of splashing and it hurts. 
* Flip the tofu back to filling side up. I know, it looks like lots of chopstick work. Well, now it is time to practices. Pour in the seasoned mushroom liquid that we prepared for cooking the tofu. Cover it. Keep the flame on medium and wait until all the liquid is gone. If your lid is completely sealed, you need to leave a small gap so the steam can escape. Turn off the heat and take out the tofu. Set that aside and we are going to make the gravy. 
* In a sauce pot, add some oil, along with some grated garlic and some diced white parts of spring onion. I reserved the green part as garnish. I also like to add some hot chilies. This is optional. If you don’t eat spicy food, you don’t need to add it. Stir until fragrant. Pour in the liquid we made before. Bring it to a boil. Then add in some cornstarch water to thicken it (1.5 tsp of cornstarch + 2 tsp of water) and your gravy is done. Pour it over the tofu. Sprinkle some spring onion for garnish. You are ready to serve.

701,"So I found some decent Blueberries, recently; Not so tangy that they overpower the Blueberry flavor, but not to so sweet that they're Bleh. The Problem is their texture. They are pretty Dry and REALLY seedy. Thus they're not really great for eating.   
So I thought about trying to do something with them, but I don't have anything to make Jam and I kinda suck at just baking Bwhahaha! I started looking for Alternative uses for them, and found that alot of fruits that have strong flavors like this, but not to suited for cooked are used in things like Stews, Roasts or Veggie dishes (I.E. a Pineapple that's to stringy, or an Apple thats to dry, etc etc)   


Unfortunately, It seems there's not really alot of examples of Blueberries being used as a mix-in for a salad/Pasta (like a chicken blueberry Alfredo) or used in a condiment or sauce (Blueberry Chipotle BBQ).   
I really don't have the Experience with this kinda thing (or cooking with fruits in general) to start experimenting myself, So I wanted to ask anyone if they had any good ideas or examples I could try.

I am left with a commercial gas range in my backyard and am now trying to figure out if its practical to have that hooked up in our backyard. So a few questions / background info to start with.

We have a large covered backyard patio that is completely open; Think of it as half of a park pavilion connected to a house. This will be put there next to a metal table.

We do not have any sort of gas tank, I'm guessing my parents were thinking that those small propane tanks would be enough but I'm thinking that they might not, even if we turn the pilot lights off every time and have the gas off. 

It is outside but we might have to install hood anyways since it will still be under a roof of sorts even though it is in an open patio. Possibly worry about moister and rust.

I noticed this with the other pans that my roommate has (all non stick) as well. My ignorance when it comes to cookware makes it difficult to even know what I'm looking for. Everywhere I've been I found nothing but nonstick pans being peddled to me. I just want a normal saucepan that I use butter or oil in to make food not stick to it. Am I looking for stainless steel, ceramic, enamel lined pots? Where do I find it? What's a good price?What is the obsession with nonstick pans? Every pan I find is nonstick, I don't want one, what do I look for?"

726,"I usually sear outside due to the smoke, but like today, it was raining outside and I didn’t want to deal with all that after uncovering the grill and exposing it to the rain (it’s mostly iron).

**Pad Thai for a crowd**

**Ingredients**

* 1 x 500g box fresh tamarind OR 1.5 T tamarind concentrate that you'll use to make 1.5 Cups Tamarind sauce
* 6 T Fish Sauce
* 8 T white sugar
* 4 T vegetable oil

* 1 lb uncooked wide rice noodles

* 6 boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cubed
* 300 grams fresh shrimp
* 3 eggs

* 2 medium carrots, matchsticked
* 6 cloves garlic minced
* 2 shallots finely minced (or ½ red onion)

* Green onion
* Bean sprouts
* Cilantro
* Crushed roast peanuts

*Peanut or vegetable oil for stir frying

**Prep:** We need to prep all the ingredients because it cooks quick.

Prepare your tamarind sauce. 

Using fresh tamarind (highly recommended) Use around 250 g tamarind, around 8-10 pods. Remove shells and fibrous stems, and soak tamarind in 1.5 cups very hot water for 30 minutes. Strain several times, mashing through a mesh strainer with a rubber spatula and rinsing in the liquid until the seeds are clean. Scrape all that tamarind gravy goodness from the bottom of the strainer into the liquid and toss the seeds.

OR

Just mix 1.5 T tamarind concentrate with 1.5 cups hot water. Do the first option, you’ll respect yourself and it tastes better. 

Mix tamarind sauce, fish sauce, sugar, and vegetable oil together well and set aside.

Soak your rice noodles in very hot water until they are extremely underdone. We will finish these in the sauce.

Prep your chicken (dice) and shrimp (remove tails if you like) and set aside.

Crack eggs and beat, set aside.

Matchstick your carrots, set aside. 

Finely mince your garlic and shallots (or red onion) and set aside.

You’re using a lot of dishes. Keep going.

Cut a few stems of green onion on the fancy bias, set those aside with your rinsed and drained bean sprouts, a couple big handfuls of those. Roughly chop a handful of cilantro and chop up about a half a cup of roasted peanuts. All these get added near the end so set them aside also in their own little hangout area.

**Cooking**

Use a wok. This is a lot of noodles and veg, a frying pan won’t cut it. Maybe if you have a deep saute pan that might work.

Crank your wok up to full and get it smoking hot. In a little hot peanut oil, add your chicken with a nice sprinkle of salt. Brown, cook through and remove to a large bowl, covered. Same with your shrimp, cook, remove and set aside. Then do your eggs. Keep the wok cranked, a little oil, pour in the eggs. It will only take a few seconds. Cook until they just form a curd and they’re not runny, and remove.

Fry your garlic and shallots, adding a little water if they dry out and threaten to burn (watch your heat, burnt garlic = bad). When they’re very fragrant and softened, toss in your noodles and mix vigorously, until the noodles are mixed well with the aromatics.

Pour in your sauce and keep the heat at full, constantly mixing. Here’s where you have to work to get the texture right, because your pre-cooking of the noodles is always different.. Stir, toss, stir, toss. Get two wok spoons going if you need to. The noodles will rapidly suck up that sauce and soften - if you run out of liquid and the noodles aren’t done, add a quarter cup of water at a time and keep going. If the noodles are done and there’s too much liquid, remove some sauce and set aside.

Once your noodles are just about perfectly chewy, add in your meat, shrimp, eggs and carrots. Keep tossing until everything is hot and mixed well, maybe another minute. 

Stir in your green onion and bean sprouts and mix thoroughly. You are making a mess by now and that’s great.

You’re done. Plate that bad boy with a solid sprinkle of chopped cilantro, roasted peanuts, and watch your guests toes curl when they take a bite. Ignore the huge mess in the kitchen.

This is not an easy recipe. You will need to finagle the liquid vs. noodles, but you’ll get the hang of it. Enjoy.

748,"Today, I wanted to share how to make Baozi, Chinese steamed buns. They seem to be becoming increasingly beloved in the West… and hey, what’s not to love? Before we get into it though, let’s just make sure we’re on the same page real quick.

See, there’s a *lot* of different Baozi variants. Broadly speaking, they can be divided into three main categories:

1.	*Leavened Baozi* (发面包子). These kinds of Baozi are fluffy and light. If you’ve ever been to China and gotten that sort of bog-standard breakfast Baozi, those are leavened Baozi. Another example would be Cantonese custard buns.

2.	*Half leavened Baozi* (半发面包子). Half leavened Baozi are a good bit firmer than the fully risen sort – this allows them to hold stuff like soup inside. If you’re familiar with Shengjianbao – that awesome, pan-fried soup Baozi that’s so ubiquitous around Shanghai… that’s a half leavened Baozi. Tianjin-style Baozi (popularized in China by the chain *Goubuli*) are also half leavened.

3.	*Unleavened Baozi* (死面包子). Ever wonder why “xiaolongbao” are categorized as a ‘bao’ and not… a ‘dumpling’ (i.e. *jiaozi*, 饺子)? Well… the short answer is that Xiaolongbao are unleavened Baozi. What does that mean for the dough, you ask? I mean… it makes it pretty damn similar to a dumpling dough. The differences between the two can get pretty byzantine, and mostly have to do with shape/thickness. Northwestern-style roast Baozi are another unleavened Baozi.

And of course, this isn’t even touching on stuff like Char Siu Bao (a special Baozi that’s made from a sourdough starter and baker’s ammonia), Posu Bao (a flaky Baozi that incorporates lard into the dough), or Taiwanese/Fujianese Gua Bao (you know… that open faced Bao that David Chang turned into a phenomenon). 

So we’ll be making that first type today – leavened Baozi. Seems like a logical starting point. Together with the dough, we’ll go through two different fillings you could toss in… a bog standard pork filling, and a similarly run-of-the-mill veg filling.

[Video is here if you’d like a visual to follow along](https://youtu.be/lGr3H7XVmng).

The way I’ll organize this is by first listing off the ingredients, then by going into how you’d generally make leavened Baozi dough, then how you’d make the fillings, and finally how you’d wrap and steam them.

**Ingredients, Baozi dough:**

1.	*All purpose flour (中筋面粉), 250g.* To be precise, the flour that we were working with had a protein content of 11%.

2.	*Water, 125g.* Or… more. We’re going to go primarily by texture here, and different flours can absorb water differently. If you’re using an older flour, you might need to up the water to ~140g depending on what you’re working with. Be sure to go by consistency (pics later in the process).

3.	*Active, Dry Yeast (酵母), 2g.* There’s two ways to make Baozi dough – the yeast method and the old school sourdough starter (*laomian*) method. If you follow these posts, I know the latter method might seem more up our alley… but we just couldn’t nail the ratios to get what we wanted in time (blast!). A Youtube upload schedule can be a harsh mistress. So we just went with what we knew, and it’s really a hyper-common approach. We’ll try to tackle the sourdough starter method when we do a half-leavened Baozi, promise (in the meantime, if you’re curious, you could [check out the Char Siu Bao](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/93dsj1/recipe_char_siu_bao_the_classic_fluffy_sort_from/) recipe we shared a while back). 

4.	*Sugar, 5g.* Give the yeast something to munch on.
 
**Ingredients, Pork Filling:**

1.	*Boston Butt (梅肉), ~90/10, 180g.* So there’s a slight difference with the Chinese ‘upper shoulder’ pork cut (*Meirou*) and the Western sort (Boston Butt) – the Chinese cut includes the clear plate, i.e. that fatty chunk at the top. Even still, for this filling we’re not aiming to get it super fatty (a stark contrast to what we usually do) – for Baozi fillings, the most critical bit is to thoroughly mix the meat with water to make it juicer. Leaner meat works great for that purpose.

2.	*Hot, Boiled Water, 60g.* We’ll be infusing this water in with the spices/aromatics in #3.

3.	*Spices/Aromatics for the water: ½ inch of ginger (姜), 3 one-inch sections of leek (大葱), 2 star anise (八角), ½ black cardamom pod - optional (草果), 1 tbsp of fennel seed (小茴香), 1 tbsp of Sichuan Peppercorns (花椒).* Smash the ginger, lightly crush the leek. The black cardamom isn’t imperative here – I know a lot of people have a devil of a time sourcing Chinese black cardamom. Just use it if you’ve got it.

4.	*Seasoning for the filling: ¼ tsp salt, ¼ tsp sugar, ½ tsp cornstarch (生粉), 1/8 tsp white pepper powder (白胡椒粉), ½ tbsp light soy sauce (生抽), ½ tsp liaojiu a.k.a. Shaoxing wine (料酒/绍兴酒), 1 tsp toasted sesame oil (麻油).*     

Note that for this particular recipe, please don’t use pre-ground pork from the supermarket if you can help it. We’ll be mincing the pork by hand – I promise this is a relatively easy hand mince, as for this one you don’t need to chop it til super pasty. Hand minced pork produces a vastly superior texture… and plus, often pre-ground meat can be a bit dry.

Last aside… supposing you wanted to work with a fattier cut like pork belly. You could absolutely straight up mince that guy in there, people do that all the time. But we’re huge believers in the Cantonese technique of taking the extra step to separately dice the pork fat (instead of mincing it). This keeps the fat from melting into grease while steaming, really allowing you to push the limit with how much fat you can toss in.

You can absolutely go that route, and we were even considering it here. But we sort of felt bad calling for that kind of technique in a dish that’s supposed to be good old-fashioned home cooking. Another possibility if you want to up the fat content is to add a veg filler – something like cabbage would be able to absorb the grease.

**Ingredients, Veg Filling:**

1.	*Napa Cabbage (大白菜), 500g.* This will be blanched, then diced and seasoned.

2.	*Seasoning for the cabbage: ½ tsp salt, ½ tsp sugar, 1/8 tsp five spice powder (五香粉), ½ tbsp light soy sauce (生抽), 1 tsp toasted sesame oil (麻油).*

3.	*Fresh Shiitake Mushrooms (香菇), 50g.* Or really any sort of fresh mushrooms I suppose. These’ll be dice, then marinated.

4.	*Marinade for the mushrooms: 1 tsp light soy sauce (生抽), ½ tsp liaojiu a.k.a. Shaoxing wine (料酒/绍兴酒), ¼ tsp sugar, ½ tsp cornstarch (生粉), ¼ tsp toasted sesame oil (麻油)*. 

5.	*Carrot, ~1/3, 50g.* Shredded, then fried with a touch of salt.

**Process, Making Leavened Baozi Dough:**

1.	*Add the yeast and sugar to the water and mix well.* Again, note that you might need to add a bit more water depending on your flour, so it could be a nice idea to start with 100 grams with this step and move on from there.

2.	*Slowly add the water into your flour.* Stir with a chopstick and aim for the dry parts.

3.	*Evaluate the consistency of your dough.* [You should be looking at something roughly like this](https://i.imgur.com/Cm0ngzU.jpg). Hopefully your camera won’t blow the highlights when you try to take a picture of it. If it’s still dry and crumbly, add a little more water.

4.	*Knead for eight minutes.* This kind of dough needs a strong gluten network in order for it to maintain its shape. If you find that your Baozi are ‘flattening’, one very likely culprit is under-kneading it.

5.	*Shape the dough into a ball.* This is a little bit Steph’s experience with baking bread rearing its head, but hey, you can’t argue with results. After kneading, there’ll be one side of the dough that’s a bit more ‘craggly’ – pinch that closed, then toss that side down on a silpat and shape the dough just like you were making bread.

6.	*Let the dough rise for 90 minutes.* Or until it doubles in size.

**Process, Meat Filling:** 

1.	*Add the spices to the hot, boiled water and let it infuse at least 30 minutes, until cooled.* Remember to crush your ginger and leek, I neglected to emphasize that in the video.

2.	*Dice the pork, then mince by hand for ~3 minutes until relatively pasty.* Dice the pork to get a nice starting point. Never minced something by hand? Dead easy, just grab either a cleaver or a Chinese chef’s knife and just go at it for a couple minutes. For this filling, we don’t need it too fine… [something like this will work great](https://i.imgur.com/xK2BhYa.jpg). See how that’s starting to get to be almost ‘pasty’? That’s not the texture of ground pork from the supermarket…

3.	*Add the seasoning to the minced pork except the toasted sesame oil, and start to stir in one direction only.* Why one direction? Not sure, really. But it seems to work.

4.	*Strain the now cooled spice water, and add it in a tablespoon at a time, stirring constantly. After adding it all, continue to stir for ~5 minutes.* Stirring helps develop the myosin in the pork, allowing it to form a stickier, more uniform whole. Similar concept as in sausage making.

5.	*Mix in the sesame oil.*

6.	*Chill until you’re ready to wrap.* This’ll wrap *way* easier if it’s cooled down. Pop it in the freezer for an hour if you can.

**Process, Veg Filling:**

1.	*Cut out the middle section of the napa cabbage and separate it from the leafy bits.* The middle section is harder and needs to be blanched for slightly longer.

2.	*Finely dice the mushrooms, shred the carrot.* Make sure the mushrooms are thoroughly wrung of any excess moisture from your washing them.

3.	*Marinate the diced mushrooms.* Add all the ingredients except the sesame oil, mix, and toss the oil in at the end. These don’t need very long to marinate, it’s mostly to help get out that sort of raw earthy flavor.

4.	*Fry the shredded carrot for about one minute, seasoning with a tiny sprinkle of salt.* ~1 tbsp of oil, medium heat. Season with salt once you’re almost finished frying it. Reserve.

5.	*Blanch the cabbage – 90 seconds for the hard middle bit, 60 seconds for the leafy parts.* Boiling water, give those a quite blanch, adding in the leafy bits at the 30 second mark. Take them out and let them cool down til they’re cool to the touch.

6.	*Wring out all the water from the cabbage, then dice it.* No need to go too fine here… let’s say ½ cm in thickness for your dice? Make sure it’s really dry before you do all this though… again, you don’t want too much moisture in your filling.

7.	*Mix the cabbage seasoning in, then toss in the mushrooms and the carrots and combine.* Fin.

**Process, how to wrap Baozi.**

Ok, that was the easy bit. Before we even get started here, I’m going to do something I’ve been trying not to do – recommend a specific timemark in the video for a visual. This can just be… really difficult for me to express with the written word sometimes. And I’m feeling a little lazy to grab any more stills. So take a look at [3:09 in the video](https://youtu.be/lGr3H7XVmng?t=3m8s) when this gets inevitably confusing.

1.	*Punch down the dough, transfer to a well-floured work surface.* It will still be a bit sticky at this point. Dust the top with some flour.

2.	*Roll the dough out into a large even sheet, covering your work surface.* For reference, we were looking at roughly 30 cm by 40 cm.

3.	*Tightly roll up the sheet of dough into a log, and cut into eight pieces.* For this recipe, each piece will be about 47.5 grams each. You obviously don’t need to nail that exactly though.

4.	*Shape each piece into a round ball.* Press the piece down to get a flat square. Fold each corner into the center, then squeeze the dough between your thumb and index finger to pinch it closed, pinching up any excess – you should be looking at something that is mostly round. Then place the ‘excess’ between your thumb and index finger, twisting it up and on top of the ball. Roll the ball a bit, shape it by twisting like bread… and you should have a real nice, even ball.

5.	*Roll out each ball into a wrapper.* Press down on a ball, then with a rolling pin, roll into the dough **without force** then press, and roll back out **with** force… working around the ball of dough. This motion helps get the center of the Baozi thicker than the edges, which’s important because (1) it allows the center to hold more filling without breaking and (2) it’s vastly easier to pleat.

6.	*Wrap the Baozi.* Add 30g of the pork filling to the Baozi wrapper, then start to pleat. Pinch down on the side, then hold that first pleat with your thumb. As you pleat, periodically press the filling down and in. Once you reach the ‘end’, close it up and twist it up towards the very top of the Baozi, pinching it to the center. Shape a bit with your hands to make sure everything’s all pretty.

7.	*As your wrap, place the Baozi in a steamer lined with Bao-sized squares of parchment paper.* Roughly 2.5” by 2.5” squares.

8.	*Place the whole steamer over some 38 centigrade water, then spritz the very top of the Baozi with a bit of water, and proof for 30 minutes.* The Baozi will get significantly larger over the course of 30 minutes. If you want smaller, denser Baozi, aim instead for ~15-20.

9.	*Steam, first placing the whole thing over high heat to bring the water up to a boil. Then lower the flame to medium, and steam those for 15 minutes.* That’s right, the steamer with the Baozi is on the pot of water as it’s getting up to a boil.

… and that’s it! Enjoy eight tasty Baozi. Feel free to double/triple this or whatever.   ","Recipe: Baozi, Steamed Buns (发面包子)",Cooking,"Today, I wanted to share how to make Baozi, Chinese steamed buns. They seem to be becoming increasingly beloved in the West… and hey, what’s not to love? Before we get into it though, let’s just make sure we’re on the same page real quick.

See, there’s a *lot* of different Baozi variants. Broadly speaking, they can be divided into three main categories:

1.	*Leavened Baozi* (发面包子). These kinds of Baozi are fluffy and light. If you’ve ever been to China and gotten that sort of bog-standard breakfast Baozi, those are leavened Baozi. Another example would be Cantonese custard buns.

2.	*Half leavened Baozi* (半发面包子). Half leavened Baozi are a good bit firmer than the fully risen sort – this allows them to hold stuff like soup inside. If you’re familiar with Shengjianbao – that awesome, pan-fried soup Baozi that’s so ubiquitous around Shanghai… that’s a half leavened Baozi. Tianjin-style Baozi (popularized in China by the chain *Goubuli*) are also half leavened.

3.	*Unleavened Baozi* (死面包子). Ever wonder why “xiaolongbao” are categorized as a ‘bao’ and not… a ‘dumpling’ (i.e. *jiaozi*, 饺子)? Well… the short answer is that Xiaolongbao are unleavened Baozi. What does that mean for the dough, you ask? I mean… it makes it pretty damn similar to a dumpling dough. The differences between the two can get pretty byzantine, and mostly have to do with shape/thickness. Northwestern-style roast Baozi are another unleavened Baozi.

And of course, this isn’t even touching on stuff like Char Siu Bao (a special Baozi that’s made from a sourdough starter and baker’s ammonia), Posu Bao (a flaky Baozi that incorporates lard into the dough), or Taiwanese/Fujianese Gua Bao (you know… that open faced Bao that David Chang turned into a phenomenon). 

So we’ll be making that first type today – leavened Baozi. Seems like a logical starting point. Together with the dough, we’ll go through two different fillings you could toss in… a bog standard pork filling, and a similarly run-of-the-mill veg filling.

[Video is here if you’d like a visual to follow along](https://youtu.be/lGr3H7XVmng).

The way I’ll organize this is by first listing off the ingredients, then by going into how you’d generally make leavened Baozi dough, then how you’d make the fillings, and finally how you’d wrap and steam them.

**Ingredients, Baozi dough:**

1.	*All purpose flour (中筋面粉), 250g.* To be precise, the flour that we were working with had a protein content of 11%.

2.	*Water, 125g.* Or… more. We’re going to go primarily by texture here, and different flours can absorb water differently. If you’re using an older flour, you might need to up the water to ~140g depending on what you’re working with. Be sure to go by consistency (pics later in the process).

3.	*Active, Dry Yeast (酵母), 2g.* There’s two ways to make Baozi dough – the yeast method and the old school sourdough starter (*laomian*) method. If you follow these posts, I know the latter method might seem more up our alley… but we just couldn’t nail the ratios to get what we wanted in time (blast!). A Youtube upload schedule can be a harsh mistress. So we just went with what we knew, and it’s really a hyper-common approach. We’ll try to tackle the sourdough starter method when we do a half-leavened Baozi, promise (in the meantime, if you’re curious, you could [check out the Char Siu Bao](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/93dsj1/recipe_char_siu_bao_the_classic_fluffy_sort_from/) recipe we shared a while back). 

4.	*Sugar, 5g.* Give the yeast something to munch on.
