I sell these small Acrylic badges with adhesive on the back that you stick up on a piece after finishing it. If you tap it three times with your phone it will permanently put the geo location of your piece on a world map under your name. 

I think this is something really cool because it allows for a global gallery to exist without anything expensive or complicated. I sell each one for $20 and you can store whatever digital content you want to share with your audience when they find your piece. 

Is this something other street artists are interested in? And what digital content would you put on each badge? A video, your site?

The process is to take several pictures (10-20 generally at a minimum) and then create a 3d model out of the images.

If we could get something like this going, I think it could be amazing.  Title the set with something like you'd do here, and add at the end photogrammetry image set.  It would help users find your images.  

Lots of people do this as a hobby and never do anything other than make models for enjoyment.

If you want to try it a bit here's a link to [MeshRoom](https://alicevision.github.io).  A completely free program.  (your computer just needs cuda support)",Request for photo takers,streetart
