I sell these small Acrylic badges with adhesive on the back that you stick up on a piece after finishing it. If you tap it three times with your phone it will permanently put the geo location of your piece on a world map under your name. 

I think this is something really cool because it allows for a global gallery to exist without anything expensive or complicated. I sell each one for $20 and you can store whatever digital content you want to share with your audience when they find your piece. 

Is this something other street artists are interested in? And what digital content would you put on each badge? A video, your site?

A standard $100 bill is 0.0043 inch thick. Take 1 inch and divide it by the thickness of a single $100 bill and you get 232.5581 (we’ll round this up to 233.) 

Now if 233 bills = 1 inch then that’s $23,300. Uzi says he’s 5’4” so to get to 6’6” we’ll multiply $23,300 by 14 to get **$326,000**. 

This doesn’t seem like much for an artist as big as Uzi so I decided to look up his net worth and discovered it’s roughly $3,000,000. How tall would he be if he stood on his net worth? I’ll tell you! If you take the 3 mil and divide it by $23,300 (1 inch of $100 bills) you’d 128.755. So if Uzi stands on his net worth instead of his cash on hand, he’d be **16 feet .75 inches** tall! Incredible.

The album literally opens with him saying ""back from the dead"", so his presence is felt throughout the whole thing.

He never left. The work was complete, some songs were almost included in the previous double-album (Underground Kingz) and the production made mostly by one of his protegés, Steve Below, with Cory Mo and Averexx, makes this hour long album the epitome of country rap tunes.

Many rappers don't really work for fame and money so if you are just about your creativity and hobby and don't care about it, this ain't post for you.

If you are looking for fame I might help you with some of my tips. Im not a rapper myself, I produce beats but I worked with many rappers and two of those got from the bottom to the top. They both followed the same formulla and If you do the same it might help you.

1.First of all you already gotta make decent music, if you are still looking for yourself and starting with rap you should keep working on that and focus on promotion later.

2.Second is obviously posting your songs on all possible platforms like fb, yt, sc, reddit...

3.Third is the most important one, build a big social circle, go out and try to meet people that are somehow connected with rap. Even having a friend that knows a guy that knows a guy that raps will get you far. You really gotta give everyone of them a listen at your music and maybe collab with other rappers. Don't be afraid of anything, I know some of you have social anxiety but if you really wanna get on top you gotta fight it, cuz internet won't get you as far as real life.

4.Fourth is when you get enough connections that you know club owners or djs. Really try to get connections with djs, they can be really useful for putting your music out there, at parties they usually play intro music before going to the real party so you can ask the dj to play your song in the club at the start or at the end when people are leaving for say 2 minutes. This request might be hard to execute sometimes because of different policies at different clubs but my rappers mostly didnt had problems with it. It is very rewarding since people will be able to see your music on club playlists the next day if someone would want to listen to your song again.

5.Fifth is going to freestyle battles at your local place. Not much to say here just make a shit ton of pre-written text and memorize it then use it.

6.Sixth is asking local rappers if you can rap at their concert for a fragement of time. if you are still 0 at fame, you will be able to pull this off with somehow famous rappers that have let's say 100 000 views per song. I've seen this many times rappers want somekind of a guest rapper and if they are just rapping in a club you can easily sneak in, but you gotta have the balls to talk to them about it before the show

7. Seven is basically creating your own website, it can be very useful in the long run

So here they are, most people can't succeed cuz they are spending their time trying to promote themselves over the internet but the truth you will gotta be pushy, social, outgoing to get your music heard. Connections is all that matters and from all the rappers I worked with the only two that succeeded made a lot of connections. I wish you all good luck on this road and understand it is a long road to success

1048,1048,"I was inspired by the recent number of international guides to hip hop on the sub, and decided i should do the same for Ireland. As an working class Irishman I’ve always related to and resonated with hip hop for various reasons. The big two being that I grew up in a working class environment and Ireland is a post colonial state that went through 800 years of oppression. This write-up will hone in on some of my favourite Irish artists and hopefully give them some well deserved shine.

Scary Éire:
Scary Éire are seen as the godfathers of Irish hip hop, with their gritty, raw and hard hitting 90s sound. The group emerged from working class housing estates in the 90s and grew a cult following. While having virtually no mainstream success their small dedicated fan base allowed them to tour all over Ireland. They have opened for a number of big hip hop acts such as Public Enemy and Gangstarr, and got a feature with Tommy Boy. Their music touches on a number of social problems such as substance abuse and collecting welfare. The song “The Dole Q” is about the line outside of a dole (welfare) office.  [“The Dole Q”](https://youtu.be/tiSDF1bT59A)

Costello:
Costello hails from Dublin, and initially rose to prominence in the late 2000s. His style is very 90s influenced and he reminds somewhat of Nas and Mos Def at times, however he still has his own distinctive style. Smooth boom bap beats and a snazzy flow are Jimmy Costello’s forte and make no mistake about it, he’s a top level lyricist. The song [High Altitude](https://youtu.be/AhaADiHRwvM) is an Irish hip hop stoner song which doesn’t stray too far from the realms of a Method Man and Redman track. His song [A Page of History ](https://youtu.be/pLmoRADNp2c) looks at Ireland’s oppressed past by Britain. In my opinion I think this track gave Irish hip hop a legitimate mandate. In a similar way to some Black Americans rappers, Costello has used hip hop as a way to talk about his community’s dark and tragic history.

Rejjie Snow: 
Rejjie is undeniably Ireland’s biggest hip hop artist globally, with his latest project [Dear Annie ](https://open.spotify.com/album/16bkk7YWytTk5I3VPMU4mv?si=rBMpZeblS9-8RzF4XZ8REw) doing solid numbers. Despite being a Dublin native, Snow has garnered some criticism here in Ireland for not having an Irish accent when he raps. In my opinion I frankly couldn’t care just because of how good is music is. Rejjie Snow first came to the forefront with his track [Dia Dhuit ](https://youtu.be/V1JeP0rOO-4) under the pseudonym Lecs Luther. With the pseudonym and the general nature of the track, i find this song to be very MF DOOM inspired. Although my favourite song by Rejjie is from him and one of my favourite rappers period, Joey Bada$$. Their track [Purple Tuesday ](https://youtu.be/Ugqn7JDBqOg) is nothing short of bliss and euphoric. Rejjie and The Badmon’s great verses toppled along with the smooth and jazzy production gives us an absolute gem. 

Kojaque: 
Kojaque is the man right now in Irish hip hop. His recent project [Deli Daydreams ](https://open.spotify.com/album/46PFhovdF7y9Q3Z7qdCohx?si=ciI1VWhjTpCNdDFCQ8ipmA) has made him an underground legend in Ireland. This album is probably my favourite Irish hip hop album. It’s a concept album which details the life and inner workings of a working class Dubliner who works in a menial deli job. The album has great rapping and brilliant jazzy production and I encourage everyone here to give it a listen. Kojaque is a man of many talents. He can make great, moody and jazzy tracks like [Bubby’s Cream](https://youtu.be/CMVMWy9fmxA) or bangers like [WiFiCode](https://youtu.be/EYyi77B7bx0). His song [Sunday Roast ](https://youtu.be/LaqcnJQIv1s) weirdly sounds similar to DUCKWORTH. by Kendrick Lamar despite being released a whole year prior to DAMN. 

Jafaris:
Jafaris is a another talented Dubliner. He’s a musically versatile artist and can pull off many styles. His latest album [Stride](https://open.spotify.com/album/4bHJFI5vP4Tybub7xxd9ak?si=C6UNUMsTQ4aD8VE7M2brFg) was released recently and it is great. A testament to his versatility would be to look at his two stylistically polar opposite songs. The bars filled and hard hitting [What You Looking Ah.](https://youtu.be/glLra6OdJcs) is inherently different from the happy go luck vibe of [Time ](https://youtu.be/of-XqCHDRGw). However the case stands that these are both two great songs from a brilliant young artist filled with potential.

Kneecap:
While virtually none of this sub will understand these lads, it’s still important to give them a mention. The two lads from Belfast are a satirical duo that rap in Irish. Check out their tracks [Amach Anocht ](https://youtu.be/L9TJMrKpe0k) and [C.E.A.R.T.A](https://youtu.be/8Sf0htzbMKk).

JYellowL: 
JYellowL is lyricist point black period. His style
Is reminiscent of the lyricists that came before us, with a modern spice. His music is very conscious and politically aware.  Check out his last two EPs [Bulletproof ](https://open.spotify.com/album/4FS92okEgASZj5qeBBXFD8?si=2aaaUYsYSvOyiY9rLDDdnA) and [Me N Me Too](https://open.spotify.com/album/66pwqWfwDvkfNe8xtYreHp?si=ben-GDR-RqKfQYgzSSHKmQ).

Nealo: 
Dublin’s Nealo’s musical style is similar of that to current Chicago artists Saba and Noname, and he opened up for Saba two weeks ago. He releases very emotional music touching on topics such as substance abuse and depression.  Check out his last project [October Year](https://open.spotify.com/album/4VOZTbwUJqmuIgyTNNyVSi?si=s5P9Qa1RTHWUXbLpuoja5w).

Rebel Phoenix: 
Rebel P is a venom spitting lyricist coming from Dublin. He embodies the New York spirit of spit bars and take names. He reminds me stylistically of Freddie Gibbs and Pusha T. Check out the Southern US influenced [Off The Books](https://youtu.be/XIS7Pf6dE_A).

7th Obi: 
Obi comes from all the way from Waterford; an unlikely place for hip hop to come from. Although this doesn’t hamper Obi’s music. He’s clearly influenced by Travis Scott which is clear from hearing his music. One of my favourite tracks by 7th Obi is [Too Many Nights ](https://youtu.be/fQ8kMnrxbyI). His latest project [Taxi Club](https://open.spotify.com/album/6kszyoGwfh3ueNaJaQQ4et?si=5YonHFM_Qdy4RUDIItthfg) was one of my favourite Irish releases of last year, and you will love it if that style of hip hop is your thing.

Thank you for taking the time to read this piece. There’s so much more artists i would love to cover, however I don’t want this post to be too long winded for whoever is reading it. I just thought that it was important to try and give my local scene some shine, due to how much Irish hip hop has came up in the last few years. Despite coming a long way there’s still more to come.

Scary Éire:
Scary Éire are seen as the godfathers of Irish hip hop, with their gritty, raw and hard hitting 90s sound. The group emerged from working class housing estates in the 90s and grew a cult following. While having virtually no mainstream success their small dedicated fan base allowed them to tour all over Ireland. They have opened for a number of big hip hop acts such as Public Enemy and Gangstarr, and got a feature with Tommy Boy. Their music touches on a number of social problems such as substance abuse and collecting welfare. The song “The Dole Q” is about the line outside of a dole (welfare) office.  [“The Dole Q”](https://youtu.be/tiSDF1bT59A)

Costello:
Costello hails from Dublin, and initially rose to prominence in the late 2000s. His style is very 90s influenced and he reminds somewhat of Nas and Mos Def at times, however he still has his own distinctive style. Smooth boom bap beats and a snazzy flow are Jimmy Costello’s forte and make no mistake about it, he’s a top level lyricist. The song [High Altitude](https://youtu.be/AhaADiHRwvM) is an Irish hip hop stoner song which doesn’t stray too far from the realms of a Method Man and Redman track. His song [A Page of History ](https://youtu.be/pLmoRADNp2c) looks at Ireland’s oppressed past by Britain. In my opinion I think this track gave Irish hip hop a legitimate mandate. In a similar way to some Black Americans rappers, Costello has used hip hop as a way to talk about his community’s dark and tragic history.

Rejjie Snow: 
Rejjie is undeniably Ireland’s biggest hip hop artist globally, with his latest project [Dear Annie ](https://open.spotify.com/album/16bkk7YWytTk5I3VPMU4mv?si=rBMpZeblS9-8RzF4XZ8REw) doing solid numbers. Despite being a Dublin native, Snow has garnered some criticism here in Ireland for not having an Irish accent when he raps. In my opinion I frankly couldn’t care just because of how good is music is. Rejjie Snow first came to the forefront with his track [Dia Dhuit ](https://youtu.be/V1JeP0rOO-4) under the pseudonym Lecs Luther. With the pseudonym and the general nature of the track, i find this song to be very MF DOOM inspired. Although my favourite song by Rejjie is from him and one of my favourite rappers period, Joey Bada$$. Their track [Purple Tuesday ](https://youtu.be/Ugqn7JDBqOg) is nothing short of bliss and euphoric. Rejjie and The Badmon’s great verses toppled along with the smooth and jazzy production gives us an absolute gem. 

Kojaque: 
Kojaque is the man right now in Irish hip hop. His recent project [Deli Daydreams ](https://open.spotify.com/album/46PFhovdF7y9Q3Z7qdCohx?si=ciI1VWhjTpCNdDFCQ8ipmA) has made him an underground legend in Ireland. This album is probably my favourite Irish hip hop album. It’s a concept album which details the life and inner workings of a working class Dubliner who works in a menial deli job. The album has great rapping and brilliant jazzy production and I encourage everyone here to give it a listen. Kojaque is a man of many talents. He can make great, moody and jazzy tracks like [Bubby’s Cream](https://youtu.be/CMVMWy9fmxA) or bangers like [WiFiCode](https://youtu.be/EYyi77B7bx0). His song [Sunday Roast ](https://youtu.be/LaqcnJQIv1s) weirdly sounds similar to DUCKWORTH. by Kendrick Lamar despite being released a whole year prior to DAMN. 

Jafaris:
Jafaris is a another talented Dubliner. He’s a musically versatile artist and can pull off many styles. His latest album [Stride](https://open.spotify.com/album/4bHJFI5vP4Tybub7xxd9ak?si=C6UNUMsTQ4aD8VE7M2brFg) was released recently and it is great. A testament to his versatility would be to look at his two stylistically polar opposite songs. The bars filled and hard hitting [What You Looking Ah.](https://youtu.be/glLra6OdJcs) is inherently different from the happy go luck vibe of [Time ](https://youtu.be/of-XqCHDRGw). However the case stands that these are both two great songs from a brilliant young artist filled with potential.

Kneecap:
While virtually none of this sub will understand these lads, it’s still important to give them a mention. The two lads from Belfast are a satirical duo that rap in Irish. Check out their tracks [Amach Anocht ](https://youtu.be/L9TJMrKpe0k) and [C.E.A.R.T.A](https://youtu.be/8Sf0htzbMKk).

JYellowL: 
JYellowL is lyricist point black period. His style
Is reminiscent of the lyricists that came before us, with a modern spice. His music is very conscious and politically aware.  Check out his last two EPs [Bulletproof ](https://open.spotify.com/album/4FS92okEgASZj5qeBBXFD8?si=2aaaUYsYSvOyiY9rLDDdnA) and [Me N Me Too](https://open.spotify.com/album/66pwqWfwDvkfNe8xtYreHp?si=ben-GDR-RqKfQYgzSSHKmQ).

Nealo: 
Dublin’s Nealo’s musical style is similar of that to current Chicago artists Saba and Noname, and he opened up for Saba two weeks ago. He releases very emotional music touching on topics such as substance abuse and depression.  Check out his last project [October Year](https://open.spotify.com/album/4VOZTbwUJqmuIgyTNNyVSi?si=s5P9Qa1RTHWUXbLpuoja5w).

Rebel Phoenix: 
Rebel P is a venom spitting lyricist coming from Dublin. He embodies the New York spirit of spit bars and take names. He reminds me stylistically of Freddie Gibbs and Pusha T. Check out the Southern US influenced [Off The Books](https://youtu.be/XIS7Pf6dE_A).

7th Obi: 
Obi comes from all the way from Waterford; an unlikely place for hip hop to come from. Although this doesn’t hamper Obi’s music. He’s clearly influenced by Travis Scott which is clear from hearing his music. One of my favourite tracks by 7th Obi is [Too Many Nights ](https://youtu.be/fQ8kMnrxbyI). His latest project [Taxi Club](https://open.spotify.com/album/6kszyoGwfh3ueNaJaQQ4et?si=5YonHFM_Qdy4RUDIItthfg) was one of my favourite Irish releases of last year, and you will love it if that style of hip hop is your thing.

Thank you for taking the time to read this piece. There’s so much more artists i would love to cover, however I don’t want this post to be too long winded for whoever is reading it. I just thought that it was important to try and give my local scene some shine, due to how much Irish hip hop has came up in the last few years. Despite coming a long way there’s still more to come. If you would like to see or hear more of the culture I suggest you go to the following :

Every Wednesday we will discuss an album from our [Essential Albums list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ewEzXRHj8LGvUB3g9QbnIK_m89I2Q5Y2LzsgqKOG6Xg/edit#gid=0)

**Last Time:** [Goodie Mob - Soul Food](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/9h96k8/hiphopheads_essential_album_of_the_week_104/)

**This Week:** [B.G.](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/1e/29/ca/1e29caea33c7875c9eff2363df956fa9.jpg) - [Chopper City ](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zl1tVlbML._SX355_.jpg)

**Background/Description (courtesy of an RYM user because I really couldn’t find anything else)**

Mannie Fresh and Cash Money had a bunch of records before 1997, but this was the year were the label really started to matter. They could not yet match the massive sales of No Limit Records, but the quality of their music stepped up and released a bunch of dope records that are better than No Limit's stuff. B.G. was one of the first rapper to release material for the label (with 1993's True Story), but he really became an important player for the label with no less than 3 albums in the same year. Chopper City was the first one released and just like all Cash Money albums, it features production from the one and only Mannie Fresh. This guy brought a whole new flavor to southern productions, what set apart his beats from those of No Limit is the amount of details he puts into them, if you pay attention closely there is always something happening in there. Lyrically I've always liked B.G., he's nothing that special with the most generic subject matters, but I don't know I like his voice and flow, his style is fresh and works quite well over these beats. While I don't think that Chopper City is Cash Money's peak, nor is it the best B.G. album, it's still a very good southern hip hop album and definitely should be checked out by those who are fans of Mannie Fresh.


**Guidelines**

This is an open thread for you to share your thoughts on the album. Avoid vague statements of praise or criticism. This is your chance to practice being a critic. It's fine for you to drop by just to say you love the album, but let's try and step it up a bit!!!


How has this album affected hip-hop? WHY do you like this tape? What are the best tracks? Do you think it deserves the praise it gets? Is it the first time you've listened to it? What's your first impression? Have you listened to the artist before? Explain why you like it or why you don't.

DON'T FEEL BAD ABOUT BEING LATE!!!! Discussion throughout the week is encouraged.

**Next week's EAOTW will be 2Pac - All Eyez On Me**

&gt;So I’m seeing on social media that a live I did 3 years ago has popped back up. A live where I talked about things I had to do in my past right or wrong that I felt I needed to do to make a living. I never claim to be perfect or come from a perfect world wit a perfect past as I always speak my truth I always own my shot. I’m a part of hip hop culture where you can talk about where you come from talk about the wrong things you had to do to get where you are. There are rappers that glorify murder, violence, drugs, and robbing. Crimes they feel they had to do to survive. I never glorifiedthe things I brought up in that live I never even put those things in my music because I’m not not proud of it and feel a responsibility not to glorify it. I made the choices that I did at the time because I had very limited options. I was blessed to have been able to rise from that but so many women have not. Whether or not they were poor choices at the time I did what I had to do to survive. The men I spoke about in my live were men that I dated that I was involved with men that were conscious willing and aware.

There are rappers that glorify murder, violence, drugs, and robbing. Crimes they feel they had to do to survive. I never glorifiedthe things I brought up in that live I never even put those things in my music because I’m not not proud of it and feel a responsibility not to glorify it. I made the choices that I did at the time because I had very limited options. I was blessed to have been able to rise from that but so many women have not. Whether or not they were poor choices at the time I did what I had to do to survive. The men I spoke about in my live were men that I dated that I was involved with men that were conscious willing and aware. I have a past that I can’t change, we all do"

As some of y’all know, my name is brandUn DeShay. I produced a lot of songs over the years but the ones we’re talking about today are “School High” &amp; “Last Cypher”.

It's been almost 2 MONTHS since I heard from Joey Bada$$ yall....
I wanna give him the benefit of the doubt that he's a much busier man than me these days, but I've also reached out to his label management over the last 5 months and still no reply.

These beats I produced for Joey were done when I was 2 or 3 yrs in and for years these songs remained FREE mixtape downloads and I had no problem with that. I never asked for bread because technically no one was getting paid.

Until recently (December 12/23/18) Joey re-released the PEEP the Aprocalypse mixtape on all streaming platforms. Therefore generating bread off streams and DID NOT ask my permission, did not do splits or even work out a deal to just buy my share of the publishing from me.

To me, if you making money off the work/effort of another man, make sure that man eating too 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️

And I hate takin shit like this public cuz usually i think that shit is corny asf... butttt I'm still tryna avoid taking this to court to retrieve the 💰. 

I hope Joey reaches back so we can figure this out... the ""producer x rapper"" relationship in Hip-Hop deserves some success stories.

Please retweet or share if this resonates at all.

I sell these small Acrylic badges with adhesive on the back that you stick up on a piece after finishing it. If you tap it three times with your phone it will permanently put the geo location of your piece on a world map under your name. 

I think this is something really cool because it allows for a global gallery to exist without anything expensive or complicated. I sell each one for $20 and you can store whatever digital content you want to share with your audience when they find your piece. 

Is this something other street artists are interested in? And what digital content would you put on each badge? A video, your site?

If we could get something like this going, I think it could be amazing.  Title the set with something like you'd do here, and add at the end photogrammetry image set.  It would help users find your images.

If we could get something like this going, I think it could be amazing.  Title the set with something like you'd do here, and add at the end photogrammetry image set.  It would help users find your images.  

Lots of people do this as a hobby and never do anything other than make models for enjoyment.

If you want to try it a bit here's a link to [MeshRoom](https://alicevision.github.io).  A completely free program.  (your computer just needs cuda support)"

Its so deep rooted. It’s not a easy fix. Hard to fix anything when kids are still living in poverty. I ain’t shutting up though, Nipsey is a True voice. He will never be silenced. He still is A stand up General for the People who never left his people. He is Loved by the people. Prayers for his family. Let’s keep pushing Truth for The Man. Love You King Nipsey Hussle/ Ermias Asghedom Respectfully, Nasir Jones](https://www.instagram.com/p/BvsbdXLHTl9/)

[**Pusha T**: Sad to see you go Nip, I’m only finding peace in knowing you are blessed. As you know, I was honored to share in such an amazing year with you musically. We spoke abt how they let the “real ones” in the building and how the Grammys “got it right” this time. I would gauge everyone’s music credibility based on if they mentioned you. “Don’t pair me or compare me, unless the said party is a rare breed...” - self. You definitely are a rare breed and I thank you for being genuine to me and in your mission to empower your people...Always love.](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bvsff9fHAjt/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)

[**Tory Lanez**: I actually don’t believe this ... like I can’t accept it. you taught me so much, 6 years ago u rented a spot Miami to wrk out of for 2 weeks . I learned so much from u in 2 days of talking to u . Last year u recorded a half finished verse on “connection” and u fell asleep on the floor of the studio exhausted from wrk and u still decided to let your nigga hold the couch .. it’s shit like that I’ll never forget . Your attitude an outlook on life is unmatched and will never be captured in its entirety by anyone but you . I’m broken about this . They always kill the good ones ! Goodbye my brother .

[**Nas**: We are at a great loss today. This hurts. Straight to the point. It’s dangerous to be an MC. Dangerous to be a b-ball player. It’s dangerous to have money. Dangerous To Be A Black Man. So much hatred. We live like our brothers and sisters in third world countries live. Right in America. Decisions we make about our own life be based on decisions cuz we might not live. Its so deep rooted. It’s not a easy fix. Hard to fix anything when kids are still living in poverty. I ain’t shutting up though, Nipsey is a True voice. He will never be silenced. He still is A stand up General for the People who never left his people. He is Loved by the people. Prayers for his family. Let’s keep pushing Truth for The Man.

[**Pusha T**: Sad to see you go Nip, I’m only finding peace in knowing you are blessed. As you know, I was honored to share in such an amazing year with you musically. We spoke abt how they let the “real ones” in the building and how the Grammys “got it right” this time. I would gauge everyone’s music credibility based on if they mentioned you. “Don’t pair me or compare me, unless the said party is a rare breed...” - self. You definitely are a rare breed and I thank you for being genuine to me and in your mission to empower your people...Always love.](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bvsff9fHAjt/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)

2751,1014,"&gt;Released on June 22, 2014, The God Complex is the debut mixtape from R&amp;B/Hip-Hop hybrid rapper GoldLink. The mixtape incorporates elements of R&amp;B, hip-hop, house, and electronica, in what GoldLink describes as “future bounce.” The only feature on the album is from Kali Uchis on the song “Divine.”

&gt;The tape is a first person narrative inspired by life in D.C., self-discovery, and the quest to understand the complex nature of God. In an interview with HipHopDX, Goldlink said:

&gt;I was trying to figure out who I was. It’s a ride. You get in your car, you put in the keys, and throw on the tape. I make references in there like, “You put the CD, so there is a God.""

2842,1105,"A decade ago the final UGK album was released, almost a year and a half after Pimp C's unexpected death. Aside from the bittersweet references done by Sleepy Brown and a ""RIP"" shoutout at the end of a long overdue guest verse of Snoop Dogg, you can't even tell Pimp was gone. The album literally opens with him saying ""back from the dead"", so his presence is felt throughout the whole thing.

He never left. The work was complete, some songs were almost included in the previous double-album (Underground Kingz) and the production made mostly by one of his protegés, Steve Below, with Cory Mo and Averexx, makes this hour long album the epitome of country rap tunes.

There isn't a song I skip. There's not a line I don't like. I can sing the whole thing, I memorized the intro and the outro.

To me this is just perfect, and there's not much else I can say to praise it.

2964,1227,"I was inspired by the recent number of international guides to hip hop on the sub, and decided i should do the same for Ireland. As an working class Irishman I’ve always related to and resonated with hip hop for various reasons. The big two being that I grew up in a working class environment and Ireland is a post colonial state that went through 800 years of oppression. This write-up will hone in on some of my favourite Irish artists and hopefully give them some well deserved shine.

Scary Éire:
Scary Éire are seen as the godfathers of Irish hip hop, with their gritty, raw and hard hitting 90s sound. The group emerged from working class housing estates in the 90s and grew a cult following. While having virtually no mainstream success their small dedicated fan base allowed them to tour all over Ireland. They have opened for a number of big hip hop acts such as Public Enemy and Gangstarr, and got a feature with Tommy Boy. Their music touches on a number of social problems such as substance abuse and collecting welfare. The song “The Dole Q” is about the line outside of a dole (welfare) office.  [“The Dole Q”](https://youtu.be/tiSDF1bT59A)

Costello:
Costello hails from Dublin, and initially rose to prominence in the late 2000s. His style is very 90s influenced and he reminds somewhat of Nas and Mos Def at times, however he still has his own distinctive style. Smooth boom bap beats and a snazzy flow are Jimmy Costello’s forte and make no mistake about it, he’s a top level lyricist. The song [High Altitude](https://youtu.be/AhaADiHRwvM) is an Irish hip hop stoner song which doesn’t stray too far from the realms of a Method Man and Redman track. His song [A Page of History ](https://youtu.be/pLmoRADNp2c) looks at Ireland’s oppressed past by Britain. In my opinion I think this track gave Irish hip hop a legitimate mandate. In a similar way to some Black Americans rappers, Costello has used hip hop as a way to talk about his community’s dark and tragic history.

Rejjie Snow: 
Rejjie is undeniably Ireland’s biggest hip hop artist globally, with his latest project [Dear Annie ](https://open.spotify.com/album/16bkk7YWytTk5I3VPMU4mv?si=rBMpZeblS9-8RzF4XZ8REw) doing solid numbers. Despite being a Dublin native, Snow has garnered some criticism here in Ireland for not having an Irish accent when he raps. In my opinion I frankly couldn’t care just because of how good is music is. Rejjie Snow first came to the forefront with his track [Dia Dhuit ](https://youtu.be/V1JeP0rOO-4) under the pseudonym Lecs Luther. With the pseudonym and the general nature of the track, i find this song to be very MF DOOM inspired. Although my favourite song by Rejjie is from him and one of my favourite rappers period, Joey Bada$$. Their track [Purple Tuesday ](https://youtu.be/Ugqn7JDBqOg) is nothing short of bliss and euphoric. Rejjie and The Badmon’s great verses toppled along with the smooth and jazzy production gives us an absolute gem. 

Kojaque: 
Kojaque is the man right now in Irish hip hop. His recent project [Deli Daydreams ](https://open.spotify.com/album/46PFhovdF7y9Q3Z7qdCohx?si=ciI1VWhjTpCNdDFCQ8ipmA) has made him an underground legend in Ireland. This album is probably my favourite Irish hip hop album. It’s a concept album which details the life and inner workings of a working class Dubliner who works in a menial deli job. The album has great rapping and brilliant jazzy production and I encourage everyone here to give it a listen. Kojaque is a man of many talents. He can make great, moody and jazzy tracks like [Bubby’s Cream](https://youtu.be/CMVMWy9fmxA) or bangers like [WiFiCode](https://youtu.be/EYyi77B7bx0). His song [Sunday Roast ](https://youtu.be/LaqcnJQIv1s) weirdly sounds similar to DUCKWORTH. by Kendrick Lamar despite being released a whole year prior to DAMN. 

Jafaris:
Jafaris is a another talented Dubliner. He’s a musically versatile artist and can pull off many styles. His latest album [Stride](https://open.spotify.com/album/4bHJFI5vP4Tybub7xxd9ak?si=C6UNUMsTQ4aD8VE7M2brFg) was released recently and it is great. A testament to his versatility would be to look at his two stylistically polar opposite songs. The bars filled and hard hitting [What You Looking Ah.](https://youtu.be/glLra6OdJcs) is inherently different from the happy go luck vibe of [Time ](https://youtu.be/of-XqCHDRGw). However the case stands that these are both two great songs from a brilliant young artist filled with potential.

Kneecap:
While virtually none of this sub will understand these lads, it’s still important to give them a mention. The two lads from Belfast are a satirical duo that rap in Irish. Check out their tracks [Amach Anocht ](https://youtu.be/L9TJMrKpe0k) and [C.E.A.R.T.A](https://youtu.be/8Sf0htzbMKk).

JYellowL: 
JYellowL is lyricist point black period. His style
Is reminiscent of the lyricists that came before us, with a modern spice. His music is very conscious and politically aware.  Check out his last two EPs [Bulletproof ](https://open.spotify.com/album/4FS92okEgASZj5qeBBXFD8?si=2aaaUYsYSvOyiY9rLDDdnA) and [Me N Me Too](https://open.spotify.com/album/66pwqWfwDvkfNe8xtYreHp?si=ben-GDR-RqKfQYgzSSHKmQ).

Nealo: 
Dublin’s Nealo’s musical style is similar of that to current Chicago artists Saba and Noname, and he opened up for Saba two weeks ago. He releases very emotional music touching on topics such as substance abuse and depression.  Check out his last project [October Year](https://open.spotify.com/album/4VOZTbwUJqmuIgyTNNyVSi?si=s5P9Qa1RTHWUXbLpuoja5w).

Rebel Phoenix: 
Rebel P is a venom spitting lyricist coming from Dublin. He embodies the New York spirit of spit bars and take names. He reminds me stylistically of Freddie Gibbs and Pusha T. Check out the Southern US influenced [Off The Books](https://youtu.be/XIS7Pf6dE_A).

7th Obi: 
Obi comes from all the way from Waterford; an unlikely place for hip hop to come from. Although this doesn’t hamper Obi’s music. He’s clearly influenced by Travis Scott which is clear from hearing his music. One of my favourite tracks by 7th Obi is [Too Many Nights ](https://youtu.be/fQ8kMnrxbyI). His latest project [Taxi Club](https://open.spotify.com/album/6kszyoGwfh3ueNaJaQQ4et?si=5YonHFM_Qdy4RUDIItthfg) was one of my favourite Irish releases of last year, and you will love it if that style of hip hop is your thing.

Thank you for taking the time to read this piece. There’s so much more artists i would love to cover, however I don’t want this post to be too long winded for whoever is reading it. I just thought that it was important to try and give my local scene some shine, due to how much Irish hip hop has came up in the last few years. Despite coming a long way there’s still more to come.

Rejjie Snow first came to the forefront with his track [Dia Dhuit ](https://youtu.be/V1JeP0rOO-4) under the pseudonym Lecs Luther. With the pseudonym and the general nature of the track, i find this song to be very MF DOOM inspired. Although my favourite song by Rejjie is from him and one of my favourite rappers period, Joey Bada$$. Their track [Purple Tuesday ](https://youtu.be/Ugqn7JDBqOg) is nothing short of bliss and euphoric. Rejjie and The Badmon’s great verses toppled along with the smooth and jazzy production gives us an absolute gem. 

Kojaque: 
Kojaque is the man right now in Irish hip hop. His recent project [Deli Daydreams ](https://open.spotify.com/album/46PFhovdF7y9Q3Z7qdCohx?si=ciI1VWhjTpCNdDFCQ8ipmA) has made him an underground legend in Ireland. This album is probably my favourite Irish hip hop album. It’s a concept album which details the life and inner workings of a working class Dubliner who works in a menial deli job. The album has great rapping and brilliant jazzy production and I encourage everyone here to give it a listen. Kojaque is a man of many talents. He can make great, moody and jazzy tracks like [Bubby’s Cream](https://youtu.be/CMVMWy9fmxA) or bangers like [WiFiCode](https://youtu.be/EYyi77B7bx0). His song [Sunday Roast ](https://youtu.be/LaqcnJQIv1s) weirdly sounds similar to DUCKWORTH. by Kendrick Lamar despite being released a whole year prior to DAMN. 

Jafaris:
Jafaris is a another talented Dubliner. He’s a musically versatile artist and can pull off many styles. His latest album [Stride](https://open.spotify.com/album/4bHJFI5vP4Tybub7xxd9ak?si=C6UNUMsTQ4aD8VE7M2brFg) was released recently and it is great. A testament to his versatility would be to look at his two stylistically polar opposite songs. The bars filled and hard hitting [What You Looking Ah.](https://youtu.be/glLra6OdJcs) is inherently different from the happy go luck vibe of [Time ](https://youtu.be/of-XqCHDRGw). However the case stands that these are both two great songs from a brilliant young artist filled with potential.

Kneecap:
While virtually none of this sub will understand these lads, it’s still important to give them a mention. The two lads from Belfast are a satirical duo that rap in Irish. Check out their tracks [Amach Anocht ](https://youtu.be/L9TJMrKpe0k) and [C.E.A.R.T.A](https://youtu.be/8Sf0htzbMKk).

JYellowL: 
JYellowL is lyricist point black period. His style
Is reminiscent of the lyricists that came before us, with a modern spice. His music is very conscious and politically aware.  Check out his last two EPs [Bulletproof ](https://open.spotify.com/album/4FS92okEgASZj5qeBBXFD8?si=2aaaUYsYSvOyiY9rLDDdnA) and [Me N Me Too](https://open.spotify.com/album/66pwqWfwDvkfNe8xtYreHp?si=ben-GDR-RqKfQYgzSSHKmQ).

Nealo: 
Dublin’s Nealo’s musical style is similar of that to current Chicago artists Saba and Noname, and he opened up for Saba two weeks ago. He releases very emotional music touching on topics such as substance abuse and depression.  Check out his last project [October Year](https://open.spotify.com/album/4VOZTbwUJqmuIgyTNNyVSi?si=s5P9Qa1RTHWUXbLpuoja5w).

Rebel Phoenix: 
Rebel P is a venom spitting lyricist coming from Dublin. He embodies the New York spirit of spit bars and take names. He reminds me stylistically of Freddie Gibbs and Pusha T. Check out the Southern US influenced [Off The Books](https://youtu.be/XIS7Pf6dE_A).

7th Obi: 
Obi comes from all the way from Waterford; an unlikely place for hip hop to come from. Although this doesn’t hamper Obi’s music. He’s clearly influenced by Travis Scott which is clear from hearing his music. One of my favourite tracks by 7th Obi is [Too Many Nights ](https://youtu.be/fQ8kMnrxbyI). His latest project [Taxi Club](https://open.spotify.com/album/6kszyoGwfh3ueNaJaQQ4et?si=5YonHFM_Qdy4RUDIItthfg) was one of my favourite Irish releases of last year, and you will love it if that style of hip hop is your thing.

Thank you for taking the time to read this piece. There’s so much more artists i would love to cover, however I don’t want this post to be too long winded for whoever is reading it. I just thought that it was important to try and give my local scene some shine, due to how much Irish hip hop has came up in the last few years. Despite coming a long way there’s still more to come. If you would like to see or hear more of the culture I suggest you go to the following :

Every Wednesday we will discuss an album from our [Essential Albums list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ewEzXRHj8LGvUB3g9QbnIK_m89I2Q5Y2LzsgqKOG6Xg/edit#gid=0)

**Last Time:** [Goodie Mob - Soul Food](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/9h96k8/hiphopheads_essential_album_of_the_week_104/)

**This Week:** [B.G.](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/1e/29/ca/1e29caea33c7875c9eff2363df956fa9.jpg) - [Chopper City ](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zl1tVlbML._SX355_.jpg)

**Background/Description (courtesy of an RYM user because I really couldn’t find anything else)**

Mannie Fresh and Cash Money had a bunch of records before 1997, but this was the year were the label really started to matter. They could not yet match the massive sales of No Limit Records, but the quality of their music stepped up and released a bunch of dope records that are better than No Limit's stuff. B.G. was one of the first rapper to release material for the label (with 1993's True Story), but he really became an important player for the label with no less than 3 albums in the same year. Chopper City was the first one released and just like all Cash Money albums, it features production from the one and only Mannie Fresh. This guy brought a whole new flavor to southern productions, what set apart his beats from those of No Limit is the amount of details he puts into them, if you pay attention closely there is always something happening in there. Lyrically I've always liked B.G., he's nothing that special with the most generic subject matters, but I don't know I like his voice and flow, his style is fresh and works quite well over these beats. While I don't think that Chopper City is Cash Money's peak, nor is it the best B.G. album, it's still a very good southern hip hop album and definitely should be checked out by those who are fans of Mannie Fresh.


**Guidelines**

This is an open thread for you to share your thoughts on the album. Avoid vague statements of praise or criticism. This is your chance to practice being a critic. It's fine for you to drop by just to say you love the album, but let's try and step it up a bit!!!


How has this album affected hip-hop? WHY do you like this tape? What are the best tracks? Do you think it deserves the praise it gets? Is it the first time you've listened to it? What's your first impression? Have you listened to the artist before? Explain why you like it or why you don't.

DON'T FEEL BAD ABOUT BEING LATE!!!! Discussion throughout the week is encouraged.

**Next week's EAOTW will be 2Pac - All Eyez On Me**
