I sell these small Acrylic badges with adhesive on the back that you stick up on a piece after finishing it. If you tap it three times with your phone it will permanently put the geo location of your piece on a world map under your name. 

I think this is something really cool because it allows for a global gallery to exist without anything expensive or complicated. I sell each one for $20 and you can store whatever digital content you want to share with your audience when they find your piece. 

Is this something other street artists are interested in? And what digital content would you put on each badge? A video, your site?

The process is to take several pictures (10-20 generally at a minimum) and then create a 3d model out of the images.

If we could get something like this going, I think it could be amazing.  Title the set with something like you'd do here, and add at the end photogrammetry image set.  It would help users find your images.  

Lots of people do this as a hobby and never do anything other than make models for enjoyment.

1014,"&gt;Released on June 22, 2014, The God Complex is the debut mixtape from R&amp;B/Hip-Hop hybrid rapper GoldLink. The mixtape incorporates elements of R&amp;B, hip-hop, house, and electronica, in what GoldLink describes as ‚Äúfuture bounce.‚Äù The only feature on the album is from Kali Uchis on the song ‚ÄúDivine.‚Äù

&gt;The tape is a first person narrative inspired by life in D.C., self-discovery, and the quest to understand the complex nature of God. In an interview with HipHopDX, Goldlink said:

&gt;I was trying to figure out who I was. It‚Äôs a ride. You get in your car, you put in the keys, and throw on the tape. I make references in there like, ‚ÄúYou put the CD, so there is a God.""

&gt;The God Complex was met with critical acclaim, appearing on numerous year end lists, include those from Spin and Complex.",[DISCUSSION] GoldLink - God Complex [5 YEARS LATER],0

1105,"A decade ago the final UGK album was released, almost a year and a half after Pimp C's unexpected death. Aside from the bittersweet references done by Sleepy Brown and a ""RIP"" shoutout at the end of a long overdue guest verse of Snoop Dogg, you can't even tell Pimp was gone. The album literally opens with him saying ""back from the dead"", so his presence is felt throughout the whole thing.

He never left. The work was complete, some songs were almost included in the previous double-album (Underground Kingz) and the production made mostly by one of his proteg√©s, Steve Below, with Cory Mo and Averexx, makes this hour long album the epitome of country rap tunes.

There isn't a song I skip. There's not a line I don't like. I can sing the whole thing, I memorized the intro and the outro.

To me this is just perfect, and there's not much else I can say to praise it. 

**Long live the Pimp!**

Tracklist:

1. Intro

2. Still on the Grind (feat. Raheem DeVaughn)

3. Everybody Wanna Ball

4. Feelin' You

5. The Pimp &amp; The Bun (feat. Ron Isley)

6. She Luv It

7. 7th Street Interlude

8. Swishas &amp; Erb (feat. Sleepy Brown)

10. Harry Asshole (feat. Lil' Boosie &amp; Webbie)

1227,"I was inspired by the recent number of international guides to hip hop on the sub, and decided i should do the same for Ireland. As an working class Irishman I‚Äôve always related to and resonated with hip hop for various reasons. The big two being that I grew up in a working class environment and Ireland is a post colonial state that went through 800 years of oppression. This write-up will hone in on some of my favourite Irish artists and hopefully give them some well deserved shine.

Scary √âire:
Scary √âire are seen as the godfathers of Irish hip hop, with their gritty, raw and hard hitting 90s sound. The group emerged from working class housing estates in the 90s and grew a cult following. While having virtually no mainstream success their small dedicated fan base allowed them to tour all over Ireland. They have opened for a number of big hip hop acts such as Public Enemy and Gangstarr, and got a feature with Tommy Boy. Their music touches on a number of social problems such as substance abuse and collecting welfare. The song ‚ÄúThe Dole Q‚Äù is about the line outside of a dole (welfare) office.  [‚ÄúThe Dole Q‚Äù](https://youtu.be/tiSDF1bT59A)

Costello:
Costello hails from Dublin, and initially rose to prominence in the late 2000s. His style is very 90s influenced and he reminds somewhat of Nas and Mos Def at times, however he still has his own distinctive style. Smooth boom bap beats and a snazzy flow are Jimmy Costello‚Äôs forte and make no mistake about it, he‚Äôs a top level lyricist. The song [High Altitude](https://youtu.be/AhaADiHRwvM) is an Irish hip hop stoner song which doesn‚Äôt stray too far from the realms of a Method Man and Redman track. His song [A Page of History ](https://youtu.be/pLmoRADNp2c) looks at Ireland‚Äôs oppressed past by Britain. In my opinion I think this track gave Irish hip hop a legitimate mandate. In a similar way to some Black Americans rappers, Costello has used hip hop as a way to talk about his community‚Äôs dark and tragic history.

Rejjie Snow: 
Rejjie is undeniably Ireland‚Äôs biggest hip hop artist globally, with his latest project [Dear Annie ](https://open.spotify.com/album/16bkk7YWytTk5I3VPMU4mv?si=rBMpZeblS9-8RzF4XZ8REw) doing solid numbers. Despite being a Dublin native, Snow has garnered some criticism here in Ireland for not having an Irish accent when he raps. In my opinion I frankly couldn‚Äôt care just because of how good is music is. Rejjie Snow first came to the forefront with his track [Dia Dhuit ](https://youtu.be/V1JeP0rOO-4) under the pseudonym Lecs Luther. With the pseudonym and the general nature of the track, i find this song to be very MF DOOM inspired. Although my favourite song by Rejjie is from him and one of my favourite rappers period, Joey Bada$$. Their track [Purple Tuesday ](https://youtu.be/Ugqn7JDBqOg) is nothing short of bliss and euphoric. Rejjie and The Badmon‚Äôs great verses toppled along with the smooth and jazzy production gives us an absolute gem. 

Kojaque: 
Kojaque is the man right now in Irish hip hop. His recent project [Deli Daydreams ](https://open.spotify.com/album/46PFhovdF7y9Q3Z7qdCohx?si=ciI1VWhjTpCNdDFCQ8ipmA) has made him an underground legend in Ireland. This album is probably my favourite Irish hip hop album. It‚Äôs a concept album which details the life and inner workings of a working class Dubliner who works in a menial deli job. The album has great rapping and brilliant jazzy production and I encourage everyone here to give it a listen. Kojaque is a man of many talents. He can make great, moody and jazzy tracks like [Bubby‚Äôs Cream](https://youtu.be/CMVMWy9fmxA) or bangers like [WiFiCode](https://youtu.be/EYyi77B7bx0). His song [Sunday Roast ](https://youtu.be/LaqcnJQIv1s) weirdly sounds similar to DUCKWORTH. by Kendrick Lamar despite being released a whole year prior to DAMN. 

Jafaris:
Jafaris is a another talented Dubliner. He‚Äôs a musically versatile artist and can pull off many styles. His latest album [Stride](https://open.spotify.com/album/4bHJFI5vP4Tybub7xxd9ak?si=C6UNUMsTQ4aD8VE7M2brFg) was released recently and it is great. A testament to his versatility would be to look at his two stylistically polar opposite songs. The bars filled and hard hitting [What You Looking Ah.](https://youtu.be/glLra6OdJcs) is inherently different from the happy go luck vibe of [Time ](https://youtu.be/of-XqCHDRGw). However the case stands that these are both two great songs from a brilliant young artist filled with potential.

Kneecap:
While virtually none of this sub will understand these lads, it‚Äôs still important to give them a mention. The two lads from Belfast are a satirical duo that rap in Irish. Check out their tracks [Amach Anocht ](https://youtu.be/L9TJMrKpe0k) and [C.E.A.R.T.A](https://youtu.be/8Sf0htzbMKk).

JYellowL: 
JYellowL is lyricist point black period. His style
Is reminiscent of the lyricists that came before us, with a modern spice. His music is very conscious and politically aware.  Check out his last two EPs [Bulletproof ](https://open.spotify.com/album/4FS92okEgASZj5qeBBXFD8?si=2aaaUYsYSvOyiY9rLDDdnA) and [Me N Me Too](https://open.spotify.com/album/66pwqWfwDvkfNe8xtYreHp?si=ben-GDR-RqKfQYgzSSHKmQ).

Nealo: 
Dublin‚Äôs Nealo‚Äôs musical style is similar of that to current Chicago artists Saba and Noname, and he opened up for Saba two weeks ago. He releases very emotional music touching on topics such as substance abuse and depression.  Check out his last project [October Year](https://open.spotify.com/album/4VOZTbwUJqmuIgyTNNyVSi?si=s5P9Qa1RTHWUXbLpuoja5w).

Rebel Phoenix: 
Rebel P is a venom spitting lyricist coming from Dublin. He embodies the New York spirit of spit bars and take names. He reminds me stylistically of Freddie Gibbs and Pusha T. Check out the Southern US influenced [Off The Books](https://youtu.be/XIS7Pf6dE_A).

7th Obi: 
Obi comes from all the way from Waterford; an unlikely place for hip hop to come from. Although this doesn‚Äôt hamper Obi‚Äôs music. He‚Äôs clearly influenced by Travis Scott which is clear from hearing his music. One of my favourite tracks by 7th Obi is [Too Many Nights ](https://youtu.be/fQ8kMnrxbyI). His latest project [Taxi Club](https://open.spotify.com/album/6kszyoGwfh3ueNaJaQQ4et?si=5YonHFM_Qdy4RUDIItthfg) was one of my favourite Irish releases of last year, and you will love it if that style of hip hop is your thing.

Thank you for taking the time to read this piece. There‚Äôs so much more artists i would love to cover, however I don‚Äôt want this post to be too long winded for whoever is reading it. I just thought that it was important to try and give my local scene some shine, due to how much Irish hip hop has came up in the last few years. Despite coming a long way there‚Äôs still more to come. If you would like to see or hear more of the culture I suggest you go to the following :

You can also recommend an artist/project/scene

Example: You guys should check out DJ Mustard's mixtape Ketchup RIYL (recommended if you like) post-hyphy and minimalistic west coast beats.

Remember, the point of this thread is to share music, try not to post stuff that's already really popular unless it answers someone's question.

**Also the more descriptive you guys are with your posts the easier it is to help you find what you want, just stating an artists name isn't that helpful since you might only like one specific aspect of that artist's music.**

They're still in my regular rotation after all these years. It's just chill ass groovy soulful jazzy Hip Hop mixes to vibe with. A lot of artists you know are on these mixes like Blu, Kev Brown, Oddisee, Phonte, Madlib, Dela, Flylo, MNDSGN, 14KT, and ESTA. But there's also a lot of deep cuts from underground artists as well.

**Background/Description (courtesy of an RYM user because I really couldn‚Äôt find anything else)**

Mannie Fresh and Cash Money had a bunch of records before 1997, but this was the year were the label really started to matter. They could not yet match the massive sales of No Limit Records, but the quality of their music stepped up and released a bunch of dope records that are better than No Limit's stuff. B.G. was one of the first rapper to release material for the label (with 1993's True Story), but he really became an important player for the label with no less than 3 albums in the same year. Chopper City was the first one released and just like all Cash Money albums, it features production from the one and only Mannie Fresh. This guy brought a whole new flavor to southern productions, what set apart his beats from those of No Limit is the amount of details he puts into them, if you pay attention closely there is always something happening in there. Lyrically I've always liked B.G., he's nothing that special with the most generic subject matters, but I don't know I like his voice and flow, his style is fresh and works quite well over these beats. While I don't think that Chopper City is Cash Money's peak, nor is it the best B.G. album, it's still a very good southern hip hop album and definitely should be checked out by those who are fans of Mannie Fresh.


**Guidelines**

This is an open thread for you to share your thoughts on the album. Avoid vague statements of praise or criticism. This is your chance to practice being a critic. It's fine for you to drop by just to say you love the album, but let's try and step it up a bit!!!


How has this album affected hip-hop? WHY do you like this tape? What are the best tracks? Do you think it deserves the praise it gets? Is it the first time you've listened to it? What's your first impression? Have you listened to the artist before? Explain why you like it or why you don't.

DON'T FEEL BAD ABOUT BEING LATE!!!! Discussion throughout the week is encouraged.

&gt;So I‚Äôm seeing on social media that a live I did 3 years ago has popped back up. A live where I talked about things I had to do in my past right or wrong that I felt I needed to do to make a living. I never claim to be perfect or come from a perfect world wit a perfect past as I always speak my truth I always own my shot. I‚Äôm a part of hip hop culture where you can talk about where you come from talk about the wrong things you had to do to get where you are. There are rappers that glorify murder, violence, drugs, and robbing. Crimes they feel they had to do to survive. I never glorifiedthe things I brought up in that live I never even put those things in my music because I‚Äôm not not proud of it and feel a responsibility not to glorify it. I made the choices that I did at the time because I had very limited options. I was blessed to have been able to rise from that but so many women have not. Whether or not they were poor choices at the time I did what I had to do to survive. The men I spoke about in my live were men that I dated that I was involved with men that were conscious willing and aware. I have a past that I can‚Äôt change, we all do",Cardi B responds to the backlash,0
